This file describes core qbank plugin changes in /question/bank/*,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 4.1 ===
* New functions qbank_usage\helper::get_question_bank_usage_sql and
  qbank_usage\helper::get_question_attempt_usage_sql have been implemented.
  When calling a query with the SQL those methods returned, you have to be sure
  in the accompanying $params array are in the right order.

=== 4.0 ===

* This plugin type is new in Moodle 4.0. It is for adding features to the question bank.
  They key entry point is the class plugin_feature in the plugin namespace. This tells
  the core question bank API exactly which features this plugin implements.
  These features can currently be new columns in the question bank display, and bulk actions.
  Currently, actions on single questions are implemented as a type of column (but this
  should probably change in the future.) To get started, have a look at the methods
  in core_question\local\bank\plugin_features_base which you can override.

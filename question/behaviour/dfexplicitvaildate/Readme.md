# Deferred feedback with explicit validation question behaviour

This Moodle question behaviour was created by Tim Hunt of the Open University.

It is like the standard deferred feedback behaviour, but with the addition of
a 'Check' button that the student can click to get Moodle to check the syntax
of their response. This question behaviour was created for use with STACK
https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/

To install, either [download the zip file](https://github.com/maths/moodle-qbehaviour_dfexplicitvaildate/zipball/master),
unzip it, and place it in the directory `moodle\question\behaviour\dfexplicitvaildate`.
(You will need to rename the directory `moodle-qbehaviour_dfexplicitvaildate -> dfexplicitvaildate`.)
Alternatively, get the code using git by running the following command in the
top level folder of your Moodle install:
    git clone git://github.com/maths/moodle-qbehaviour_dfexplicitvaildate.git question/behaviour/dfexplicitvaildate

For full install instructions, see the [STACK install instructions](https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/doc/en/Installation/index.md).

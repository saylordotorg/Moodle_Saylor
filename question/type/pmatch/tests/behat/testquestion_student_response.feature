  Scenario: Confirm a student cannot access the test this question feature.
    When I am on the "My first pattern match question" "qtype_pmatch > test responses" page logged in as student
    Then I should see "Sorry, but you do not currently have permissions to do that (view)"
    And I should not see "Pattern-match question testing tool: Testing question: My first pattern match question"
    And I should not see "Showing the responses for the selected question: My first pattern match question"

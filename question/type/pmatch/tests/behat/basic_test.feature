  As an teacher
  I need to create and preview pattern match questions.

  Background:
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | format |
      | Course 1 | C1        | topics |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname |
      | teacher  | Teacher   |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user    | course | role           |
      | teacher | C1     | editingteacher |

  Scenario: Create, edit then preview a pattern match question.
    When I am on the "Course 1" "core_question > course question bank" page logged in as teacher
    # Create a new question.
    And I add a "Pattern match" question filling the form with:
      | Question name                 | My first pattern match question    |
      | Question text                 | Listen, translate and write        |
      | id_usecase                    | Yes, case must match                                            |

Installing spell-checking
=========================

Linux and Mac
-------------

I think this just works becasue these OSes come with the enchant library for PHP.

If it is not working, chech that the enchant extension is listed in php.ini, and
check you can use aspell from teh command-line.

Windows
-------

You definitely need to add extension=php_enchant.dll in your php.ini.

Then, you need to install some dictionaries, as described here:
https://www.kildclient.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5411

1. Download the LibreOffice extension containing the dictionary for the language you want
   from the extensions repository: https://extensions.libreoffice.org/extensions?getCategories=Dictionary&getCompatibility=any
   The direct link for English is https://extensions.libreoffice.org/extensions/english-dictionaries.

2. The downloaded file is a Zip archive, just with a different extension. Rename the
   downloaded file changing the .oxt extension to .zip, and open it.

3. Inside, locate two files with .aff and .dic extensions. There should be two files
   with the same name and these two extensions. Depending on the package you have
   downloaded, there might be other files (such as hyphenation support files) with
   similar names. Those are not used by enchant.

4. Copy the .aff and .dic files to the[... path to your PHP install ...]\share\myspell\dicts folder.
   If this is the first dictionary you are installing, you will need to create the folders.

A good one-liner to test it is working from the command-line is:

   php -r '$broker = enchant_broker_init(); var_dump($broker); var_dump(enchant_broker_list_dicts($broker));'


Note: French (https://extensions.libreoffice.org/extensions/dictionnaires-francais) seems to
be tricky. There are various .aff and .dic, and the names do not match what enhant expects.
I think what you need to do is to take the two fr-toutesvariantes.[aff|dic] files, and rename
them to fr_FR.[aff|dic] after copying into \share\myspell\dicts.

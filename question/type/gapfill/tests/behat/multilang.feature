        @javascript
        Scenario: Create a question and check mlang2 works as expected
            #  When the filter_multilang2 plugin is installed
              And I am on the "Course 1" "core_question > course question bank" page logged in as teacher1
                # Create a new question with mlang2 tags
                # Then check that the french words are not displayed
              And I add a "Gapfill" question filling the form with:
                  | Question name | Gapfill-001                                                    |
                  | Question text | The {mlang fr}chat{mlang}{mlang en}cat{mlang} sat on the [mat] |
             Then I should see "Gapfill-001"

  # Preview it.
              And I am on the "Gapfill-001" "core_question > preview" page
              And I should see "cat"
              And I should not see "chat"

        @javascript
        Scenario: Create a question and check (core) mlang works as expected
             When I am on the "Course 1" "core_question > course question bank" page logged in as teacher1
              And I add a "Gapfill" question filling the form with:

             Then I should see "Gapfill-002"
    #Check that the french words are not displayed

Feature: Test all the basic functionality of this Gapfill question type
    In order to evaluate students responses, As a teacher I need to
  create and preview gapfill questions.

  Background:
    Given the following "users" exist:
        | username | firstname | lastname | email               |
        | teacher  | Mark      | Allright | teacher@example.com |
    And the following "courses" exist:
        | fullname | shortname | category |
        | Course 1 | C1        | 0        |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
        | user    | course | role           |
        | teacher | C1     | editingteacher |

  @javascript
  Scenario: Create, edit then preview a gapfill question.
    When I am on the "Course 1" "core_question > course question bank" page logged in as teacher
    # Create a new question.
    And I add a "item_qtype_gapfill" question filling the form with:
        | Question name                  | Gapfill-001                           |
        | Question text                  | The cat [sat] on the [mat]            |
        | General feedback               | This is general feedback              |
        | Penalty for each incorrect try | 0.3333333                             |
        | Hint 1                         | Incorrect placements will be removed. |
        | id_hintclearwrong_0            | 1                                     |
        | id_hintshownumcorrect_0        | 1                                     |
        | Hint 2                         | Incorrect placements will be removed. |
        | id_hintclearwrong_1            | 0                                     |
        | id_hintshownumcorrect_1        | 1                                     |
    Then I should see "Gapfill-001"

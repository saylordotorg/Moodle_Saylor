## Introduction

CodeRunner is a Moodle question type that allows teachers to run a program in
order to grade a student's answer. By far the most common use of CodeRunner is
in programming courses where students are asked to write program code to some
specification and that code is then graded by running it in a series of tests.
CodeRunner questions have also been used in other areas of computer science and
engineering to grade questions in which many different correct answers are
possible and a program must be used to assess correctness.

Regardless of the behaviour chosen for a quiz, CodeRunner questions always
run in an adaptive mode, in which students can click a Check button to see
if their code passes the tests defined in the question. If not, students can
resubmit, typically for a small penalty. In the typical 'all-or-nothing' mode,
all test cases must pass if the submission is to be awarded any marks.
The mark for a set of questions in a quiz is then determined primarily by
which questions the student is able to solve successfully and then secondarily
by how many submissions the student makes on each question.
However, it is also possible to configure CodeRunner questions so
that the mark is determined by how many of the tests the code successfully passes.

CodeRunner has been in use at the University of Canterbury for over seven years,
running millions of student quiz question submissions in Python, C , JavaScript,
PHP, Octave and Matlab. Laboratory work, assignment work and mid-semester tests
in the introductory first year Python programming course (COSC121),
which has around 650 students in the first semester and 350 in the second,
re all assessed using CodeRunner questions. The final exams for COSC121 have
also been run using Moodle/CodeRunner since November 2014. Other courses at
the University of Canterbury using CodeRunner include:

 * ENCE260 Computer Systems
 * ENCN305 Programming, Statistics and Optimisation
 * EMTH171 Mathematical Modelling and Computation
 * SENG02 Software Engineering I
 * COSC261 Formal Languages and Compilers
 * COSC 262 Algorithms
 * COSC367 Computational Intelligence
 * ENCE360 Operating Systems
 * SENG365 Web Computing Architectures

CodeRunner is also being used at over 600 other sites worldwide.

CodeRunner currently supports Python2 (considered obsolescent), Python3,
C, C++, Java, PHP, JavaScript (NodeJS), Octave and Matlab.
The architecture allows easy extension to other languages.

CodeRunner can safely be used on an institutional Moodle server,
provided that the sandbox software in which code is run ("Jobe")
is installed on a separate machine with adequate security and
firewalling. However, if CodeRunner-based quizzes are to be used for
tests and final exams, a separate Moodle server is recommended, both for
load reasons and so that various Moodle communication facilities, like
chat and messaging, can be turned off without impacting other classes.

The CodeRunner question type can be installed on any modern Moodle system
(version 3.0 or later), on Linux, Windows and Mac. For security reasons
submitted jobs are run on a separate machine called the "Jobe server" or
"Jobe sandbox machine". CodeRunner is intitially configured to use a small
outward-facing Jobe server at the University of Canterbury, and this can
be used for initial testing.  However, this is not suitable for production
use, for which institutions will need to install their own Jobe server.
Instructions for installing a Jobe server are given in the Jobe documentation.
Once Jobe is installed, use the Moodle administrator interface for the
CodeRunner plug-in to specify the Jobe host name and perhaps port number.

A single 4-core Moodle server can handle an average quiz question
submission rate of about 60 quiz questions per minute while maintaining
a response time of less than about 3 - 4 seconds, assuming the student code
itself runs in a fraction of a second. We have run CodeRunner-based exams
with nearly 300 students and experienced only light to moderate load factors
on an 8-core Moodle server. The Jobe server, which runs student submissions
(see below), is even more lightly loaded during such an exam.

Some videos introducing CodeRunner and explaining question authoring
are available in [this youtube channel](https://coderunner.org.nz/mod/url/view.php?id=472).

## Installation

This chapter describes how to install CodeRunner. It assumes the
existence of a working Moodle system, version 2.6 or later (including
Moodle 3).

If you are installing for the first time, jump straight to section 2.2.

### Upgrading from a CodeRunner version earlier than 2.4.0

The current version of CodeRunner is incompatible with versions prior to
2.4.0. If you're attempting to upgrade from an earlier version, you should
first upgrade to the most recent version 2 (checkout branch V2 in the repository).
That will upgrade all questions in the database to a format that can be handled
by current versions.

If you are already running CodeRunner version 2.4.0 or later, you can upgrade
simply by following the instructions in the next two sections.

### Upgrading from CodeRunner versions between 2.4 and 3.0

Upgrading to version 3.1 from version 2.4 through 3.0 should generally be
straightforward though, as usual, you should make a database backup before
upgrading. To upgrade, simply install the latest code and login to the web
interface as an administrator. When Moodle detects the
changed version number it will run upgrade code that updates all questions to
the latest format.

However, if you have written your own question types
you should be aware that all existing questions in the system
`CR_PROTOTYPES` category with names containing the
string `PROTOTYPE_` are deleted by the installer/upgrader.
The installer then re-loads them from the file

    db/questions-CR_PROTOTYPES.xml

Hence if you have developed your own question prototypes and placed them in
the system `CR_PROTOTYPES` category (not recommended) you must export them
in Moodle XML format before upgrading. You can then re-import them after the
upgrade is complete using the usual question-bank import function in the
web interface. However, it is strongly recommended that you do not put your
own question prototypes in the `CR_PROTOTYPES` category but create a new
category for your own use.

#### Note for enthusiasts only.

Versions from 3.1 onwards no-longer allows a question to have both a per-test
template and a combinator template: questions must have one or the other. In
upgrading from Version 3.0 and earlier, the combinator template is used if "Enable
combinator" was set or a combinator template grader is being used, otherwise
the per-test template is used. This should not change the behaviour of the
question *provided* the two templates are consistent in the sense that running
any test in the per-test template yields exactly the same result as running
that same test all by itself in the combinator template.


### Installing CodeRunner from scratch

CodeRunner requires two separate plug-ins, one for the question type and one
for the specialised adaptive behaviour. The plug-ins are in two
different github repositories: `github.com/trampgeek/moodle-qbehaviour_adaptive_adapted_for_coderunner`
and `github.com/trampgeek/moodle-qtype_coderunner`. Install the two plugins
using one of the following two methods.

EITHER:

1. Download the zip file of the required branch from the [coderunner github repository](https://github.com/trampgeek/moodle-qtype_coderunner)
unzip it into the directory `moodle/question/type` and change the name
of the newly-created directory from `moodle-qtype_coderunner-<branchname>` to just
`coderunner`. Similarly download the zip file of the required question behaviour
from the [behaviour github repository](https://github.com/trampgeek/moodle-qbehaviour_adaptive_adapted_for_coderunner),
unzip it into the directory `moodle/question/behaviour` and change the
newly-created directory name to `adaptive_adapted_for_coderunner`.
OR

1. Get the code using git by running the following commands in the
top level folder of your Moodle install:

        git clone https://github.com/trampgeek/moodle-qtype_coderunner.git question/type/coderunner
        git clone https://github.com/trampgeek/moodle-qbehaviour_adaptive_adapted_for_coderunner.git question/behaviour/adaptive_adapted_for_coderunner

Either way you may also need to change the ownership
and access rights to ensure the directory and
its contents are readable by the webserver.

You can then complete the
installation by logging onto the server through the web interface as an
administrator and following the prompts to upgrade the database as appropriate.

In its initial configuration, CodeRunner is set to use a University of
Canterbury [Jobe server](https://github.com/trampgeek/jobe) to run jobs. You are
welcome to use this during initial testing, but it is
not intended for production use. Authentication and authorisation
on that server is
via an API-key and the default API-key given with CodeRunner imposes
a limit of 100
per hour over all clients using that key, worldwide. If you decide that CodeRunner is
useful to you, *please* set up your own Jobe sandbox as
described in *Sandbox configuration* below.

WARNING: at least a couple of users have broken CodeRunner by duplicating
the prototype questions in the System/CR\_PROTOTYPES category. `Do not` touch
those special questions until you have read this entire manual and
are familiar with the inner workings of CodeRunner. Even then, you should
proceed with caution. These prototypes are not
for normal use - they are akin to base classes in a prototypal inheritance
system like JavaScript's. If you duplicate a prototype question the question
type will become unusable, as CodeRunner doesn't know which version of the
prototype to use.

### Preliminary testing of the CodeRunner question type

Once you have installed the CodeRunner question type, you should be able to
run CodeRunner questions using the University of Canterbury's Jobe Server
as a sandbox. It is
recommended that you do this before proceeding to install and configure your
own sandbox.

Using the standard Moodle web interface, either as a Moodle
administrator or as a teacher in a course you have set up, go to the Question
Bank and try creating a new CodeRunner question. A simple Python3 test question
is: "Write a function *sqr(n)* that returns the square of its
parameter *n*.". The introductory quick-start guide in the incomplete
[Question Authoring Guide](https://github.com/trampgeek/moodle-qtype_coderunner/blob/master/authorguide.md)
gives step-by-step instructions for creating such a question. Alternatively
you can just try to create a question using the on-line help in the question
authoring form. Test cases for the question might be:

<table>
<tr><th>Test</th><th>Expected</th></tr>
<tr><td>print(sqr(-7))</td><td>49</td></tr>
<tr><td>print(sqr(5))</td><td>25</td></tr>
<tr><td>print(sqr(-1))</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>print(sqr(0))</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>print(sqr(-100))</td><td>10000</td></tr>
</table>

You could check the 'UseAsExample' checkbox on the first two (which results
in the student seeing a simple "For example" table) and perhaps make the last
case a hidden test case. (It is recommended that all questions have at least
one hidden test case to prevent students synthesising code that works just for
the known test cases).

Save your new question, then preview it, entering both correct and
incorrect answers.

If you want a few more CodeRunner questions to play with, try importing the
files
`MoodleHome>/question/type/coderunner/samples/simpledemoquestions.xml` and/or
`MoodleHome>/question/type/coderunner/samples/python3demoquestions.xml`.
These contains
most of the questions from the two tutorial quizzes on the
[demo site](http://www.coderunner.org.nz).
If you wish to run the questions in the file `python3demoquestions.xml`,
you will also need to import
the file `MoodleHome>/question/type/coderunner/samples/uoc_prototypes.xml`
or you will receive a "Missing prototype" error.

Also included in the *samples* folder is a prototype question,
`prototype\_c\_via\_python.xml`
 that defines a new question type, equivalent to the built-in *c\_program*
type, by scripting in Python the process of compiling and running the student
code. This is a useful template for authors who wish to implement their own
question types or who need to support non-built-in languages. It is discussed
in detail in the section "Supporting or implementing new languages".

### Setting the quiz review options

It is important that students get shown the result table when they click *Check*.
For this to happen the "Specific feedback" checkbox in the Review options for
the quiz (under *Settings*) must be checked in the "During the attempt" column.
It will automatically be checked
if the quiz was created with the question behaviour set to *Adaptive* but will
otherwise be unchecked by default. Changing the question behaviour after the
quiz has been created does not currently change the review options.

Other recommended setting in the "During the attempt column" are:

 1. Right answer. This should be unchecked, at least in the "During the attempt"
    column and possibly elsewhere, if you don't want your sample answers leaked
    to the whole class.

 1. Whether correct. This should probably be unchecked if the quiz includes
    any non-coderunner questions. It doesn't appear to affect CodeRunner
    feedback but if left checked will result in other questions types
    displaying an excessive amount of help  when *Check* is clicked.

 1.  Marks and General feedback. These should probably be checked.

### Sandbox Configuration

Although CodeRunner has a flexible architecture that supports various different
ways of running student task in a protected ("sandboxed") environment, only
one sandbox - the Jobe sandbox - is supported by the current version. This
sandbox makes use of a
separate server, developed specifically for use by CodeRunner, called *Jobe*.
As explained
at the end of the section on installing CodeRunner from scratch, the initial
configuration uses the Jobe server at the University of Canterbury. This is not
suitable for production use. Please switch
to using your own Jobe server as soon as possible.

To build a Jobe server, follow the instructions at
[https://github.com/trampgeek/jobe](https://github.com/trampgeek/jobe). Then use the
Moodle administrator interface for the CodeRunner plug-in to specify the Jobe
host name and perhaps port number. Depending on how you've chosen to
configure your Jobe server, you may also need to supply an API-Key through
the same interface.

A video walkthrough of the process of setting up a Jobe server
on a DigitalOcean droplet, and connecting an existing CodeRunner plugin to it, is
available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGpnQpLnERw).

If you intend running unit tests you
will also need to copy the file `tests/fixtures/test-sandbox-config-dist.php`
to 'tests/fixtures/test-sandbox-config.php', then edit it to set the correct
host and any other necessary configuration for the Jobe server.

Assuming you have built *Jobe* on a separate server, the JobeSandbox fully
isolates student code from the Moodle server. However, Jobe *can* be installed
on the Moodle server itself, rather than on a
completely different machine. This works fine,
but is much less secure than running Jobe on
a completely separate machine. If a student program manages to break out of
the sandbox when it's running on a separate machine, the worst it can do is
bring the sandbox server down, whereas a security breach on the Moodle server
could be used to hack into the Moodle database, which contains student run results
and marks. That said, our Computer Science department used an earlier even less
secure Sandbox for some years without any ill effects. Moodle keeps extensive logs
of all activities, so a student deliberately breaching security is taking a
huge risk.

### Running the unit tests

If your Moodle installation includes the
*phpunit* system for testing Moodle modules, you might wish to test the
CodeRunner installation. Most tests require that at least python2 and python3
are installed.

Before running any tests you first need to copy the file
`<moodlehome>/question/type/coderunner/tests/fixtures/test-sandbox-config-dist.php`
to '<moodlehome>/question/type/coderunner/tests/fixtures/test-sandbox-config.php',
then edit it to set whatever configuration of sandboxes you wish to test,
and to set the jobe host, if appropriate. You should then initialise
the phpunit environment with the commands

        cd <moodlehome>
        sudo php admin/tool/phpunit/cli/init.php

You can then run the full CodeRunner test suite with one of the following two commands,
depending on which version of phpunit you're using:

        sudo -u www-data vendor/bin/phpunit --verbose --testsuite="qtype_coderunner test suite"

or

        sudo -u www-data vendor/bin/phpunit --verbose --testsuite="qtype_coderunner_testsuite"

If you're on a Red Hat or similar system in which the web server runs as
*apache*, you should replace *www-data* with *apache.

TThe unit tests will almost certainly show lots of skipped or failed tests relating
to the various sandboxes and languages that you have not installed, e.g.
the LiuSandbox, Matlab, Octave and Java. These can all be ignored unless you plan to use
those capabilities. The name of the failing tests should be sufficient to
tell you if you need be at all worried.

Feel free to [email the principal developer](mailto:richard.lobb@canterbury.ac.nz) if you have problems
with the installation.

## The Architecture of CodeRunner

Although it's straightforward to write simple questions using the
built-in question types, anything more advanced than that requires
an understanding of how CodeRunner works.

The block diagram below shows the components of CodeRunner and the path taken
as a student submission is graded.

<img src="http://coderunner.org.nz/pluginfile.php/145/mod_page/content/2/coderunnerarchitecture.png" width="473" height="250" />

Following through the grading process step by step:

1. For each of the test cases, the [Twig template engine](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/)
merges the student's submitted answer with
the question's template together with code for this particular test case to yield an executable program.
By "executable", we mean a program that can be executed, possibly
with a preliminary compilation step.
1. The executable program is passed into whatever sandbox is configured
   for this question (usually the Jobe sandbox). The sandbox compiles the program (if necessary) and runs it,
   using the standard input supplied by the testcase.
1. The output from the run is passed into whatever Grader component is
   configured, as is the expected output specified for the test case. The most common grader is the
   "exact match" grader but other types are available.
1. The output from the grader is a "test result object" which contains
   (amongst other things) "Expected" and "Got" attributes.
1. The above steps are repeated for all testcases, giving an array of
   test result objects (not shown explicitly in the figure).
1. All the test results are passed to the CodeRunner question renderer,
   which presents them to the user as the Results Table. Tests that pass
   are shown with a green tick and failing ones shown with a red cross.
   Typically the whole table is coloured red if any tests fail or green
   if all tests pass.

The above description is somewhat simplified.

Firstly, it is not always necessary to
run a different job in the sandbox for each test case. Instead, all tests can often
be combined into a single executable program. This is achieved by use of what is known as
a "combinator template" rather than the simpler "per-test template" described
above. Combinator templates are useful with questions of the *write-a-function*
or *write-a-class* variety. They are not often used with *write-a-program* questions,
which are usually tested with different standard inputs, so multiple
execution runs are required. Furthermore, even with write-a-function questions
that do have a combinator template,
CodeRunner will revert to running tests one-at-a-time (still using the combinator
template) if running all tests in the one program gives some form of runtime error,
in order that students can be
presented with all test results up until the one that failed.

Combinator templates are explained in the *Templates*
section.

Secondly, the above description of the grading process ignores *template graders*,
which do grading as well as testing. These support more advanced testing
strategies, such as running thousands of tests or awarding marks in more complex
ways than is possible with the standard option of either "all-or-nothing" marking
or linear summation of individual test marks.

A per-test-case template grader can be used to define each
row of the result table, or a combinator template grader can be used to
defines the entire feedback panel, with or without a result table.
See the section on grading templates for
more information.

## Question types

CodeRunner support a wide variety of question types and can easily be
extended to support others. A CodeRunner question type is defined by a
*question prototype*, which specifies run time parameters like the execution
language and sandbox and also the template that define how a test program is built from the
question's test-cases plus the student's submission. The prototype also
defines whether the correctness of the student's submission is assessed by use
of an *EqualityGrader*, a *NearEqualityGrader*, a *RegexGrader* or a
*TemplateGrader*. The EqualityGrader expects
the output from the test execution to exactly match the expected output
for the testcase. The NearEqualityGrader is similar but is case insensitive
and tolerates variations in the amount of white space (e.g. missing or extra
blank lines, or multiple spaces where only one was expected).
The RegexGrader expects a regular expression match
instead. Template graders are more complicated but give the question author almost
unlimited flexibility in controlling the execution, grading and result
display; see the section *Grading with templates*.

The EqualityGrader is recommended for most normal use, as it
encourages students to get their output exactly correct; they should be able to
resubmit almost-right answers for a small penalty, which is generally a
better approach than trying to award part marks based on regular expression
matches.

Test cases are defined by the question author to check the student's code.
Each test case defines a fragment of test code, the standard input to be used
when the test program is run and the expected output from that run. The
author can also add additional files to the execution environment.

The test program is constructed from the test case information plus the
student's submission using the template defined by the prototype. The template
can be either a *per-test template*, which defines a different program for
each test case or a *combinator template*, which has the ability to define a program that combines
multiple test cases into a single run. Templates are explained in the *Templates*
section.

### An example question type

The C-function question type expects students to submit a C function, plus possible
additional support functions, to some specification. As a trivial example, the question
might ask "Write a C function with signature `int sqr(int n)` that returns
the square of its parameter *n*". The author will then provide some test
cases of the form

    printf("%d\n", sqr(-11));

and give the expected output from this test.

A per-test template for such a question type would then wrap the
submission and
the test code into a single program like:

    #include <stdio.h>

    // --- Student's answer is inserted here ----

    int main()
    {
        printf("%d\n", sqr(-11));
        return 0;
    }

which would be compiled and run for each test case. The output from the run would
then be compared with
the specified expected output (121) and the test case would be marked right
or wrong accordingly.

That example assumes the use of a per-test template rather than the more complicated
combinator template that is actually used by the built-in C function question type.
See the section
on *templates* for more.

### Built-in question types

The file `<moodlehome>/question/type/coderunner/db/builtin_PROTOTYPES.xml`
is a moodle-xml export format file containing the definitions of all the
built-in question types. During installation, and at the end of any version upgrade,
the prototype questions from that file are all loaded into a category
`CR_PROTOTYPES` in the system context. A system administrator can edit
those prototypes but this is not recommended as the modified versions
will be lost on each upgrade. Instead, a category `LOCAL_PROTOTYPES`
(or other such name of your choice) should be created and copies of any prototype
questions that need editing should be stored there, with the question-type
name modified accordingly. New prototype question types can also be created
in that category. Editing of prototypes is discussed later in this
document.

Built-in question types include the following:

 1. **c\_function**. This is the question type discussed in the above
example, except that it uses a combinator template. The student supplies
 just a function (plus possible support functions) and each test is (typically) of the form

        printf(format_string, func(arg1, arg2, ..))

 The template for this question type generates some standard includes, followed
 by the student code followed by a main function that executes the tests one by
 one. However, if any of the test cases have any standard input defined, the
 template is expanded and executed separately for each test case.

 The manner in which a C (or any other) program is executed is not part of the question
 type definition: it is defined by the particular sandbox to which the
 execution is passed. The Jobe sandbox
 uses the `gcc` compiler with the language set to
 accept C99 and with both *-Wall* and *-Werror* options set on the command line
 to issue all warnings and reject the code if there are any warnings.

 1. **cpp\_function**. This is the C++ version of the previous question type.
The student supplies just a function (plus possible support functions)
and each test is (typically) of the form

        cout << func(arg1, arg2, ..)

 The template for this question type generates some standard includes, followed
 by the line

    using namespace std;

followed by the student code followed by a main function that executes the tests one by
 one.

1. **c\_program** and **cpp\_program**. These two very simple question types
require the student to supply
a complete working program. For each test case the author usually provides
`stdin` and specifies the expected `stdout`. The program is compiled and run
as-is, and in the default all-or-nothing grading mode, must produce the right
output for all test cases to be marked correct.

 1. **python3**. Used for most Python3 questions. For each test case, the student
code is run first, followed by the test code.

 1. **python3\_w\_input**. A variant of the *python3* question in which the
`input` function is redefined at the start of the program so that the standard
input characters that it consumes are echoed to standard output as they are
when typed on the keyboard during interactive testing. A slight downside of
this question type compared to the *python3* type is that the student code
is displaced downwards in the file so that line numbers present in any
syntax or runtime error messages do not match those in the student's original
code.

 1. **python2**. Used for most Python2 questions. As for python3, the student
code is run first, followed by the sequence of tests. This question type
should be considered to be obsolescent due to the widespread move to Python3
through the education community.

 1. **java\_method**. This is intended for early Java teaching where students are
still learning to write individual methods. The student code is a single method,
plus possible support methods, that is wrapped in a class together with a
static main method containing the supplied tests (which will generally call the
student's method and print the results).

 1. **java\_class**. Here the student writes an entire class (or possibly
multiple classes in a single file). The test cases are then wrapped in the main
method for a separate
public test class which is added to the students class and the whole is then
executed. The class the student writes may be either private or public; the
template replaces any occurrences of `public class` in the submission with
just `class`. While students might construct programs
that will not be correctly processed by this simplistic substitution, the
outcome will simply be that they fail the tests. They will soon learn to write
their
classes in the expected manner (i.e. with `public` and `class` on the same
line, separated by a single space)!

 1. **java\_program**. Here the student writes a complete program which is compiled
then executed once for each test case to see if it generates the expected output
for that test. The name of the main class, which is needed for naming the
source file, is extracted from the submission by a regular expression search for
a public class with a `public static void main` method.

 1. **octave\_function**. This uses the open-source Octave system to process
matlab-like student submissions.

 1. **php**. A php question in which the student submission is a normal php
file, with PHP code enclosed in <?php ... ?> tags and the output is the
usual PHP output including all HTML content outside the php tags.

Other less commonly used built-in question types are:
*python3\_w\_input*, *nodejs*, *pascal\_program* and *pascal\_function*.

As discussed later, this base set of question types can
be customised or extended in various ways.

### Some more-specialised question types

The following question types used to exist as built-ins but have now been
dropped from the main install as they are intended primarily for University
of Canterbury (UOC) use only. They can be imported, if desired, from the file
`uoc_prototypes.xml`, located in the CodeRunner/coderunner/samples folder.

The UOC question types include:

 1. **python3\_cosc121**. This is a complex Python3 question
type that's used at the University of Canterbury for nearly all questions in
the COSC121 course.  The student submission
is first passed through the [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/)
source code analyser and the submission is rejected if pylint gives any errors.
Otherwise testing proceeds as normal. Obviously, *pylint* needs to be installed
on the sandbox server. This question type takes many different template
parameters (see the section entitled *Template parameters* for an explanation
of what these are) to allow it to be used for a wide range of different problems.
For example, it can be configured to require or disallow specific language
constructs (e.g. when requiring students to rewrite a *for* loop as a *while*
loop), or to limit function size to a given value, or to strip the *main*
function from the student's code so that the support functions can be tested
in isolation. Details on how to use this question type, or any other, can
be found by expanding the *Question Type Details* section in the question
editing page.

 1. **matlab\_function**. Used for Matlab function questions. Student code must be a
function declaration, which is tested with each testcase. The name is actually
a lie, as this question type now uses Octave instead, which is much more
efficient and easier for the question author to program within the CodeRunner
context. However, Octave has many subtle differences
from Matlab and some problems are inevitable. Caveat emptor.

 1. **matlab\_script**. Like matlab\_function, this is a lie as it actually
uses Octave. It runs the test code first (which usually sets up a context)
and then runs the student's code, which may or may not generate output
dependent on the context. Finally the code in Extra Template Data is run
(if any). Octave's `disp` function is replaced with one that emulates
Matlab's more closely, but, as above: caveat emptor.


## Templates

Templates are the key to understanding how a submission is tested. Every question
has a template, either imported from the question type or explicitly customised,
which defines how the executable program is constructed from the student's
answer, the test code and other custom code within the template itself.

A question's template can be either a *per-test template* or a *combinator
template*. The first one is the simpler; it is applied once for every test
in the question to yield an executable program which is sent to the sandbox.
Each such execution defines one row of the result table. Combinator templates,
as the name implies, are able to combine multiple test cases into a single
execution, provided there is no standard input for any of the test cases. We
will discuss the easier per-test template first.

### Per-test templates

A *per\_test\_template* is essentially a program with "placeholders" into which
are inserted the student's answer and the test code for the test case being run.
The expanded template is then sent to the sandbox where it is compiled (if necessary)
and run with the standard input defined in the testcase. The output returned
from the sandbox is then matched against the expected output for the testcase,
where a 'match' is defined by the chosen validator: an exact match,
a nearly exact match or a regular-expression match.

Expansion of the template is done by the
[Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) template engine. The engine is given both
the template and a variable called
STUDENT\_ANSWER, which is the text that the student entered into the answer box,
plus another called TEST, which is a record containing the test-case
that the question author has specified
for the particular test. The TEST attributes most likely to be used within
the template are TEST.testcode (the code to execute for the test), TEST.stdin
(the standard input for the test -- not normally used within a template, but
occasionally useful) and TEST.extra (the extra test data provided in the
question authoring form). The template will typically use just the TEST.testcode
field, which is the "test" field of the testcase. It is usually
a bit of code to be run to test the student's answer.

When Twig processes the template, it replaces any occurrences of
strings of the form `{{ TWIG\_VARIABLE }}` with the value of the given
TWIG_VARIABLE (e.g. STUDENT\_ANSWER). As an example,
the question type *c\_function*, which asks students to write a C function,
might have the following template (if it used a per-test template):

        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <stdlib.h>
        #include <ctype.h>

        {{ STUDENT_ANSWER }}

        int main() {
            {{ TEST.testcode }};
            return 0;
        }

A typical test (i.e. `TEST.testcode`) for a question asking students to write a
function that
returns the square of its parameter might be:

        printf("%d\n", sqr(-9))

with the expected output of 81. The result of substituting both the student
code and the test code into the template might then be the following program
(depending on the student's answer, of course):

        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <stdlib.h>
        #include <ctype.h>

        int sqr(int n) {
            return n * n;
        }

        int main() {
            printf("%d\n", sqr(-9));
            return 0;
        }

When authoring a question you can inspect the template for your chosen
question type by temporarily checking the 'Customise' checkbox. Additionally,
if you check the *Template debugging* checkbox you will get to see
in the output web page each of the
complete programs that gets run during a question submission.

### Combinator templates

The template for a question is by default defined by the code runner question
type, which itself is defined by a special "prototype" question, to be explained later.
You can inspect the template of any question by clicking the customise box in
the question authoring form. You'll also find a checkbox labelled *Is combinator*.
If this checkbox is checked the template is a combinator template. Such templates
take the STUDENT\_ANSWER template variable as shown above, but rather than
taking just a single TEST variable, they take a TESTCASES variable, which is
is a list of all the individual TEST objects.

The actual template used by the built-in C function question type is not actually
a per-test template as suggested above, but is the following combinator template.

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <ctype.h>
    #include <string.h>
    #include <stdbool.h>
    #include <math.h>
    #define SEPARATOR "#<ab@17943918#@>#"

    {{ STUDENT_ANSWER }}

    int main() {
    {% for TEST in TESTCASES %}
       {
        {{ TEST.testcode }};
       }
        {% if not loop.last %}printf("%s\n", SEPARATOR);{% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
        return 0;
    }

The Twig template language control structures are wrapped in `{%`
and `%}`. If a C-function question had two three test cases, the above template
might expand to something like the following:

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <ctype.h>
    #include <string.h>
    #include <stdbool.h>
    #include <math.h>
    #define SEPARATOR "#<ab@17943918#@>#"

    int sqr(int n) {
        return n * n;
    }

    int main() {
        printf("%d\n", sqr(-9));
        printf("%s\n", SEPARATOR);
        printf("%d\n", sqr(11));
        printf("%s\n", SEPARATOR);
        printf("%d\n", sqr(-13));
        return 0;
    }

The output from the execution is then the outputs from the three tests
separated by a special separator string, which can be customised for each
question if desired. On receiving the output back from the sandbox, CodeRunner
then splits the output using the separator into three separate test outputs,
exactly as if a per-test template had been used on each test case separately.

The use of a combinator template is problematic with questions that require standard input;
if each test has its own standard input, and all tests are combined into a
single program, what is the standard input for that program? The easiest
resolution to this problem is simply to fall back to running each test
separately. That is achieved by using the combinator template but feeding it
a singleton list of testcases each time, i.e. the list [test[0]] on the first
run, [test[1]] on the second and so on. The combinator template is then
functioning just like a per-test template.

However, advanced combinator templates can actually manage the multiple
runs themselves, e.g. using Python Subprocesses. To enable this, there
is a checkbox "Allow multiple stdins" which, if checked, reverts to the usual
combinator mode of passing all testcases to the combinator template in a
single run.

The use of a combinator also becomes problematic if the student's code causes
a premature abort due
to a run error, such as a segmentation fault or a CPU time limit exceeded. In
such cases, CodeRunner reruns the tests, using the combinator template in
a per-test mode, as described above.

### Customising templates

As mentioned above, if a question author clicks in the *customise* checkbox,
the question template is made visible and can be edited by the question author
to modify the behaviour for that question.

As a simple example, consider the following question:

"What is the missing line in the *sqr* function shown below, which returns
the square of its parameter *n*?"

    int sqr(int n) {
        // What code replaces this line?
    }

Suppose further that you wished the test column of the result table to display
just, say, `sqr(-11)` rather than `printf("%d, sqr(-11));`

You could set such a question using a template like:

        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <stdlib.h>
        #include <ctype.h>

        int sqr(int n) {
           {{ STUDENT_ANSWER }}
        }

        int main() {
            printf("%d\n", {{ TEST.testcode }});
            return 0;
        }

The authoring interface
allows the author to set the size of the student's answer box, and in a
case like the above you'd typically set it to just one or two lines in height
and perhaps 30 columns in width.

The above example was chosen to illustrate how template editing works, but it's
not a very compelling practical example. It would generally be easier for
the author and less confusing for the student if the question were posed as
a standard built-in write-a-function question, but using the *Preload* capability
in the question authoring form to pre-load the student answer box with something
like

    // A function to return the square of its parameter n
    int sqr(int n) {
        // *** Replace this line with your code

If you're customising templates, or developing your own question type (see later),
the combinator template doesn't normally offer
sufficient additional benefit to warrant the complexity increase
unless you have a
large number of testcases or are using
a slow-to-launch language like Matlab. It is recommended that you always start
with a per-test template, and move to a combinator template only if you have
an obvious performance issue.

## Using the template as a script for more advanced questions

It may not be obvious from the above that the template mechanism allows
for almost any sort of question where the answer can be evaluated by a computer.
In all the examples given so far, the student's code is executed as part of
the test process but in fact there's no need for this to happen. The student's
answer can be treated as data by the template code, which can then execute
various tests on that data to determine its correctness. The Python *pylint*
question type mentioned earlier is a simple example: the template code first
writes the student's code to a file and runs *pylint* on that file before
proceeding with any tests.

The per-test template for a simple `pylint` question type might be:

    import subprocess
    import os
    import sys

    def code_ok(prog_to_test):
        """Check prog_to_test with pylint. Return True if OK or False if not.
           Any output from the pylint check will be displayed by CodeRunner
        """
        try:
            source = open('source.py', 'w')
            source.write(prog_to_test)
            source.close()
            env = os.environ.copy()
            env['HOME'] = os.getcwd()
            cmd = ['pylint', 'source.py']
            result = subprocess.check_output(cmd,
                universal_newlines=True, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, env=env)
        except Exception as e:
            result = e.output

        if result.strip():
            print("pylint doesn't approve of your program", file=sys.stderr)
            print(result, file=sys.stderr)
            print("Submission rejected", file=sys.stderr)
            return False
        else:
            return True

    if code_ok(__student_answer__):
        __student_answer__ = """{{ STUDENT_ANSWER | e('py') }}"""
        __student_answer__ += '\n' + """{{ TEST.testcode | e('py') }}"""
        exec(__student_answer__)

The Twig syntax {{ STUDENT\_ANSWER | e('py') }} results in the student's submission
being filtered by an escape function appropriate for the language Python, which escapes all
double quote and backslash characters with an added backslash.

Note that any output written to *stderr* is interpreted by CodeRunner as a
runtime error, which aborts the test sequence, so the student sees the error
output only on the first test case.

The full `Python3_pylint` question type is much more complex than the
above, because it includes many extra features, enabled by use of template
parameters (see later).

Some other complex question types that we've used include:

 1. A Matlab question in which the template code (also Matlab) breaks down
    the student's code into functions, checking the length of each to make
    sure it's not too long, before proceeding with marking.

 1. Another advanced Matlab question in which the template code, written in
    Python runs the student's Matlab code, then runs the sample answer supplied within
    the question, extracts all the floating point numbers is both, and compares
    the numbers of equality to some given tolerance.

 1. A Python question where the student's code is actually a compiler for
    a simple language. The template code runs the student's compiler,
    passes its output through an assembler that generates a JVM class file,
    then runs that class with the JVM to check its correctness.

 1. A Python question where the students submission isn't code at all, but
    is a textual description of a Finite State Automaton for a given transition
    diagram; the template code evaluates the correctness of the supplied
    automaton.

The second example above makes use of two additional CodeRunner features not mentioned
so far:

  - the ability to set the Ace code editor, which is used to provide syntax
highlighting code-entry fields, to use a different language within the student
answer box from that used to run the submission in the sandbox.

  - the use of the QUESTION template variable, which contains all the
attributes of the question including its question text, sample answer and
template parameters (see below).

### Twig Escapers

As explained above, the Twig syntax {{ STUDENT\_ANSWER | e('py') }} results
in the student's submission
being filtered by a Python escape function that escapes all
all double quote and backslash characters with an added backslash. The
python escaper e('py') is just one of the available escapers. Others are:

 1. e('java'). This prefixes single and double quote characters with a backslash
    and replaces newlines, returns, formfeeds, backspaces and tabs with their
    usual escaped form (\n, \r etc).

 1. e('c').  This is an alias for e('java').

 1. e('matlab'). This escapes single quotes, percents and newline characters.
    It must be used in the context of Matlab's sprintf, e.g.

        student_answer = sprintf('{{ STUDENT_ANSWER | e('matlab')}}');

 1. e('js'), e('html') for use in JavaScript and html respectively. These
    are Twig built-ins. See the Twig documentation for details.

Escapers are used whenever a Twig variable is being expanded within the
template to generate a literal string within the template code. Usually the
required escaper is that
of the template language, e.g. e('py') for a template written in Python.
Escapers must *not* be used if the Twig variable is to be expanded directly
into the template program, to be executed as is.

## Template parameters

It is sometimes necessary to make quite small changes to a template over many
different questions. For example, you might want to use the *pylint* question
type given above but change the maximum allowable length of a function in different
questions. Customising the template for each such question has the disadvantage
that your derived questions no longer inherit from the original prototype, so
that if you wish to alter the prototype you will also need to find
and modify all the
derived questions, too.

In such cases a better approach is to use template parameters, which can
be defined by the question author in the "Template params" field of the question
editing form. This field must be set to a JSON-encoded record containing
definitions of variables that can be used by the template engine to perform
local per-question customisation of the template. The template parameters
are passed to the template engine as the object `QUESTION.parameters`. In
addition, if the *Hoist template parameters* checkbox is checked (which
is now the default behaviour) the `QUESTION.parameters` prefix can be dropped.

For example, suppose we wanted a more advanced version of the *python3\_pylint*
question type that allows customisation of the pylint options via template parameters.
We might also wish to insert a module docstring for "write a function"
questions. Lastly we might want the ability to configure the error message if
pylint errors are found.

The template parameters might be:

    {
        "isfunction": false,
        "pylintoptions": ["--disable=missing-final-newline", "--enable=C0236"],
        "errormessage": "Pylint is not happy with your program"
    }

The template for such a question type might then be:

    import subprocess
    import os
    import sys
    import re

    def code_ok(prog_to_test):
    {% if QUESTION.parameters.isfunction %}
        prog_to_test = "'''Dummy module docstring'''\n" + prog_to_test
    {% endif %}
        try:
            source = open('source.py', 'w')
            source.write(prog_to_test)
            source.close()
            env = os.environ.copy()
            env['HOME'] = os.getcwd()
            pylint_opts = []
    {% for option in QUESTION.parameters.pylintoptions %}
            pylint_opts.append('{{option}}')
    {% endfor %}
            cmd = ['pylint', 'source.py'] + pylint_opts
            result = subprocess.check_output(cmd,
                universal_newlines=True, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, env=env)
        except Exception as e:
            result = e.output

        # Have to remove pylint's annoying config file output message before
        # checking for a clean run. [--quiet option in pylint 2.0 fixes this].
        result = re.sub('Using config file.*', '', result).strip()
        if result:
            print("{{QUESTION.parameters.errormessage | e('py')}}", file=sys.stderr)
            print(result, file=sys.stderr)
            return False
        else:
            return True


    __student_answer__ = """{{ STUDENT_ANSWER | e('py') }}"""
    if code_ok(__student_answer__):
        __student_answer__ += '\n' + """{{ TEST.testcode | e('py') }}"""
        exec(__student_answer__)

If *Hoist template parameters* is checked, all `QUESTION.parameters.` prefixes
can be dropped.

### The Twig QUESTION variable

The template variable `QUESTION` is an object containing all the fields of the
PHP question object. Some of the other
QUESTION fields/attributes that might be of interest to authors include the
following.

 * `QUESTION.questionid` The unique internal ID of this question.
 * `QUESTION.questiontext` The question text itself
 * `QUESTION.answer` The supplied sample answer (null if not explicitly set).
 * `QUESTION.answerpreload` The string that is preloaded into the answer box.
 * `QUESTION.language` The language being used to run the question in the sandbox,
e.g. "Python3".
 * `QUESTION.globalextra` Extra data for use by template authors, global to all tests.
 * `QUESTION.useace` '1'/'0' if the ace editor is/is not in use.
 * `QUESTION.sandbox` The sandbox being used, e.g. "jobesandbox".
 * `QUESTION.grader` The PHP grader class being used, e.g. "EqualityGrader".
 * `QUESTION.cputimelimitsecs` The allowed CPU time (null unless explicitly set).
 * `QUESTION.memlimitmb` The allowed memory in MB (null unless explicitly set).
 * `QUESTION.sandboxparams` The JSON string used to specify the sandbox parameters
in the question authoring form (null unless explicitly set).
 * `QUESTION.templateparams` The JSON string used to specify the template
parameters in the question authoring form. (Normally the question author
will not use this but will instead access the specific parameters as in
the previous section).
 * `QUESTION.resultcolumns` The JSON string used in the question authoring
form to select which columns to display, and how to display them (null
unless explicitly set).

Most of these are effectively read only - assigning a new value within the
template to the `cputimelimitsecs` attribute does not alter the actual run time;
the assignment statement is being executed in the sandbox after all resource
limits have been set. The question author can however directly alter all
the above question attributes directly in the question authoring form.


### The Twig STUDENT variable

The template variable `STUDENT` is an object containing a subset of the fields of the
PHP user object. The fields/attributes of STUDENT are:

 * `STUDENT.id` The unique internal id of the current user (an integer).
 * `STUDENT.username` The unique internal username of the current user.
 * `STUDENT.firstname` The first name of the current user.
 * `STUDENT.lastname` The last name of the current user.
 * `STUDENT.email` The email address of the current user.

### Twig macros

Twig has a [macro capability](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/1.x/tags/macro.html)
that provides something akin to functions in normal programming languages.
Macros can be stored in one Twig template and imported from there into another.

In the CodeRunner context there is only a single template available
at any time - usually the question's so-called *template* field,
although other question fields are
expanded if *TwigAll* is set. CodeRunner does not provide access to
an associated file system from which
templates of macros can be loaded or created by question authors.
However, CodeRunner does
provide a few macros in a support (pseudo) template named "html". These
macros are primarily intended for use with the Html UI (q.v.); each one inserts
a named HTML element into the template that is being expanded. As an
example, if the question author includes the following in a question field

    {% from 'html' import input %}

    ...

    {{ input('fieldname', 15) }}

and that question is subject to Twig expansion, the invocation of the *input*
macro will generate the HTML code

    <input name="somename" class="coderunner-ui-element" width="15">

All macros name take a mandatory name parameter and additional parameters as follows.
Optional parameters and their default values are indicated with an equals sign.

  1. `input(name, width=10)` generates an input element as in the above example.
  2. `textarea(name, rows=2, cols=60)` to generate an HTML *textarea* element.
  3. `select(name, options)` generates an HTML select element with a sequence
of embedded `option` elements as defined by the second parameter, which must be
an array with elements that are either strings or 2-element string arrays.
If a single string is provided as the array elements,
it is used as both the value attribute of the option element and its inner
HTML. If a 2-element array is provided, the first string is used as the value
and the second as the inner HTML.
  4. `radio(name, items)` generates a vertically-aligned sequence of
mutually exclusive radio buttons, one for each of the elements of the `items`
parameter, which must be
an array with elements that are either strings or 2-element string arrays. As with
*select* options, if an element is a single string it is used as both the radio
button label and its value. But if a 2-element array is provided, the first
element is the value attribute of the `input` element (the radio button) and
the second is the label.
  5. `checkbox(name, label, ischecked=false)` generates a checkbox with the given name,
and label, which is checked only if ischecked is true.

To reduce the risk that the UI element names conflict with existing UI element
names in the Moodle page, all names are prefixed by `crui_`.

## Randomising questions

Sometimes one wants a question that presents different variations of itself
to each student. As a trivial example, a generalisation of a `Hello world`
program might ask students to write a program that prints `Hello <name>`,
where there are many different values for `name`.

By way of introduction, a Python version of the above example above is easily achieved,
albeit with only four different names, as follows:

1. Set the template parameters field of the question authoring form to
    ```
    { "name": "{{ random(["Bob", "Carol", "Ted", "Alice"]) }}" }
    ```
1. Turn on the *Twig All* checkbox, so that all fields of the question will
   get processed by Twig, once the template parameters have been set up.
1. Turn on the *Hoist template parameters* checkbox if necessary. It's on by
   default for new questions but off for old questions.
1. Set the question text to *Write a program that prints `Hello {{ name }}`*
1. Set the expected output of the first test case to `Hello {{ name }}`
1. Set the sample answer to `print("Hello {{name}}")`

The underlying mechanism will now be explained in more detail. It assumes
the reader already understands the basic workings of CodeRunner, in particular
how the [Twig template engine](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) is used to
convert the question's template into an executable program and how that
process can be parameterised by use of CodeRunners *template parameters*


### How it works

When a student starts a Moodle quiz, an instance of each quiz question is generated.
As each quiz question is instantiated, certain variables need to be defined,
such as the order in which shuffled options will be presented in a multichoice
question. These variables are essentially "frozen" throughout the lifetime of that particular
question instance, including when it is subsequently reviewed or regraded.

When a CodeRunner question is instantiated, the template parameters field is
processed by the Twig template engine. If there's no embedded Twig within the
template, the template parameters field will not change. However, if the
template does actually
include embedded Twig code, the output from
Twig will be different from the input. Usually any embedded Twig code will make
at least one call to the Twig *random* function, resulting in one or more
template parameters having randomised values. The above example shows a case
in which the template parameter "name" is assigned a randomly-chosen value
from a list of options. Another common variant is

    { "number": {{ 5 + random(7) }} }

which will result in the template parameter *number* having a uniformly
distributed integer value in the
range 5 to 12 inclusive.

If the *Twig All* checkbox for the question is checked,
all other text fields of the question, except for the template
itself, are processed by Twig directly after the template parameters field
has been Twigged. This yields new values for the question text, test cases etc,
which are used
throughout the question's lifetime. The Twig environment used when processing
all these
other fields is that defined by the Twigged template parameters field.

It is usual to click the *Twig All* checkbox with randomised questions, as otherwise only
the template will be subject to randomisation, which isn't usually appropriate.

### Randomising per-student rather than per-question-attempt

CodeRunner adds a new function *set_random_seed(seedvalue)* to Twig. This
is a call through to the underlying PHP *mt_srand* function to define the
state of the pseudo random number generator. The return value is the empty string.
If a call to this function is
made from within the Twigged template parameters before any calls are made
to the *random* function, the same sequence of randomisations will be
performed every time the question is attempted. If the *id* field of the
Twig STUDENT variable
is used as the seed value, the effect is then that a particular
student only ever sees one variant of the question, no matter how often they
attempt a question. A typical use might be to begin the template parameters
with the line

    {{- set_random_seed(STUDENT.id) -}}

Tip: don't add this line until you've checked out several variants of the
question, because once you've added it, you'll only ever see the one variant
yourself.

### An important warning about editing template parameters

The above description is a slight simplification. It implies that all the
Twig-expanded template parameters are recorded within the question instance and
frozen throughout the question lifetime. Such an approach, while technically
"correct", creates problems for question authors who, after a quiz has gone
live, discover they need to make changes to the *non-randomised* template
parameters. For example, a template parameter that sets a limit on the allowed
number of lines of code might turn out to be too restrictive. The
author might wish to raise the limit and
regrade existing submissions with the changed parameters.
If the parameters were strictly frozen, this
wouldn't be possible. So instead the implementation records only the random number
seed, and rebuilds the set of template parameters whenever the question is
reloaded from the database.

However, it is *vital* that question authors do not make any changes that might
alter the randomised template parameters once a quiz has gone live. For example,
re-ordering the randomised parameters will result in their being given
different values when the question is reloaded. The student will then see
a different question, to which their answer is no longer correct. Regrading
would then result in their getting zero marks for a question they have already
passed. Even if they've submitted and closed the quiz, they will find, if they
subsequently review it, that their answer doesn't match the question.

To recap: *once a quiz has gone live, you must ensure that any editing of
the template parameters does not alter the randomisation behaviour*.

Caveat Emptor.

### Hoisting the template parameters

Prior to the implementation of randomisation, template parameters were used
only within the template, where it was standard practice to
refer to template parameters with the syntax {{QUESTION.parameters.x}} where
*x* is a parameter. However, that syntax becomes very clumsy when the same
parameters is being used in lots of different places within the question.
There is now a checkbox *Hoist template parameters*, which copies the
template parameters into the Twig global name space, where STUDENT_ANSWER,
TEST etc reside. The variable *x* can then be inserted into the text simply
by writing `{{ x }}`.

C++ programmers might wish to think of this as similar to
the line

    using namespace std;

Hoisting was not done automatically because it might have broken existing
questions if the Twig code were using similar variables globally. Hence, when
upgrading an older version of CodeRunner to one that has randomisation, the
*Hoist template parameters* checkbox is set to false. However, it is set
to true on newly created questions.

### Miscellaneous tips

1. Read the Twig documentation!

1. Check out the sample questions in the question export file
   `randomisationexamples.xml` in the CodeRunner *samples* folder.

1. Sometimes you need a set of random variables to be "coupled". For example
    you might want an `animal` to be one of `dog`, `cat`, `cow` and an associated
    variable `sound` to be respectively `woof`, `miaow`, `moo`. Three ways of achieving
    this are:
    1. Create a single random `index` variable and use that to index into
       separate animal and sound lists. For example:

            {
                {% set index = random(2) %}
                "animal": "{{ ["Dog", "Cat", "Cow"][index] }}",
                "sound":  "{{ ["Woof", "Miaow", "Moo"][index] }}"

    1. Select an animal at random from a list of Twig 'hash' objects, then plug
       each of the animal attributes into the JSON record. For example:

            {
                {% set obj = random([
                    {'name': 'Dog', 'sound': 'Woof'},
                    {'name': 'Cat', 'sound': 'Miaow'},
                    {'name': 'Cow', 'sound': 'Moo'}
                ]) %}
                "animal": "{{ obj.name }}",
                "sound":  "{{ obj.sound }}"
             }

    1. Select an animal at random from a list of Twig 'hash' objects as above,
       but then json_encode the entire object as a single template parameter.
       For example

            {
                {% set animal = random([
                    {'name': 'Dog', 'sound': 'Woof'},
                    {'name': 'Cat', 'sound': 'Miaow'},
                    {'name': 'Cow', 'sound': 'Moo'}
                ]) %}
                "animal": {{ animal | json_encode }}
             }

    In the last case, the template parameters will need to be referred to as
    {{ animal.name }} and {{ animal.sound }} instead of {{ animal }} and {{ sound }}.

1. Since the Twig output must be JSON, and newlines aren't allowed in JSON
   strings, you may find the Twig whitespace control modifiers (`{{-` and `-}}`)
   useful in more complex Twig programs. As an example, the following Twig
   code uses a recursive macro plus whitespace control modifiers to
   generate a JSON structure that defines a value `expression`, which
   is a random fully-parenthesised infix expression.

        {% macro randomexpr(depth) %}
        {% from _self import randomexpr as expr %}
        {% if depth >= 5 %}{# Leaf nodes are random operands #}
            {{- random(["a", "b", "c", "d"]) -}}
        {% else %}{# Internal nodes are of the form ( expr op expr ) #}
            {{- '(' -}}
            {{- expr(depth + 1 + random(3)) -}}
            {{- random(['*', '/', '+', '-']) -}}
            {{- expr(depth + 1 + random(3)) -}}
            {{- ')' -}}
        {% endif %}
        {% endmacro %}

        {% import _self as exp %}
        { "expression": "{{ exp.randomexpr(0) }}"}


 This generates expressions like

        (((c+b)+d)-(a*((c-a)-d)))

 and

        (((a/(a-d))-(c/b))+(d+(((d/c)/d)*(c+a))))

1. The [TwigFiddle web site](http://twigfiddle.com) is useful for debugging Twig code
   in your template parameters.
   You can enter your template parameter field, click Run, and see the resulting
   JSON. Alternatively, you can set up a trivial question that simply prints
   the values of the QUESTION.parameters Twig variable. For example (in Python)

        print("""{{QUESTION.parameters | json_encode}}""")

## Grading with templates

Grading of student submissions can be problematic in some situations.
For example, you may need to
ask a question where many different valid program outputs are possible, and the
correctness can only be assessed by a special testing program. Or
you may wish to subject
a student's code to a very large
number of tests and award a mark according to how many of the test cases
it can handle. The usual exact-match
grader cannot handle these situations. For such cases the *TemplateGrader* option
can be selected in the *Grading* field of the question authoring form, after
clicking the *Customise* checkbox. The template
code then has a somewhat different role: the output from running the expanded
template program is required to be a JSON string that defines the mark allocated
to the student's answer and
provides appropriate feedback.

A template grader
behaves in two very different ways depending on whether the template is a
per-test template or a combinator template.

### Per-test-case template grading

When the template is a per-test template and a TemplateGrader is selected, the
output from the program must be a JSON string that defines one row of the
test results table. [Remember that per-test templates are expanded and run
once for each test case.] The JSON object must contain
at least a 'fraction' field, which is multiplied by TEST.mark to decide how
many marks the test case is awarded. It should usually also contain a 'got'
field, which is the value displayed in the 'Got' column of the results table.
The other columns of the results table (testcode, stdin, expected) can, if desired, also
be defined by the template grader and will then be used instead of the values from
the test case. As an example, if the output of the program is the string

    {"fraction":0.5, "got": "Half the answers were right!"}

half marks would be
given for that particular test case and the 'Got' column would display the
text "Half the answers were right!".

For even more flexibility the *result_columns* field in the question editing
form can be used to customise the display of the test case in the result
table. That field allows the author to define an arbitrary number of arbitrarily
named result-table columns and to specify using *printf* style formatting
how the attributes of the grading output object should be formatted into those
columns. For more details see the section on result-table customisation.

Writing a grading template that executes the student's code is, however,
rather difficult as the generated program needs to be robust against errors
in the submitted code. The template-grader should always return a JSON object
and should not generate any stderr output.

Although template graders can be written in any language, the developer
finds it convenient to write them in Python, regardless of
the language in which the student answer is written. Python's subprocess
module can be used to execute the student code plus whatever test code is required.
This ensures that errors in the syntax  or runtime errors in the student code
do not break the template program itself, allowing it to output a JSON
answer regardless. Some examples of per-test template graders are given in
the section *Template grader examples*.

Sometimes the author of a template grader wishes to abort the testing of the
program after a test case, usually the first, e.g. when pre-checks on the
acceptability of a student submission fail. This can be achieved by defining
in the output JSON object an extra attribute `abort`, giving it the boolean
value `true`. If such
an attribute is defined, any supplied `fraction` value will be ignored, the
test case will be marked wrong (equivalent to `fraction = 0`) and all further
test cases will be skipped. For example:

`{"fraction":0.0, "got":"Invalid submission!", "abort":true}`

Note to Python programmers: the Python boolean literals are `True` and `False` but the
JSON boolean literals are `true` and `false`. The superficial similarity of JSON objects
to Python dictionaries is also confusing. Usually, in Python, you will generate
the JSON objects using the `dumps` function in the `json` module, passing it a
Python dictionary, further adding to the confusion!

For example, to generate the above JSON output (with lower case `t` in `true`)
you would write

`json.dumps({"fraction":0.0, "got":"Invalid submission!", "abort":True})`


### Combinator-template grading

The ultimate in grading flexibility is achieved by use of a "Combinator
template grader", i.e. a TemplateGrader with the `Is combinator` checkbox checked.
In this mode, the JSON string output by the template grader
should again contain a 'fraction' field, this time for the total mark,
and may contain zero or more of 'prologuehtml', 'testresults', 'epiloguehtml'
'showoutputonly' and 'showdifferences'
attributes.
The 'prologuehtml' and 'epiloguehtml' fields are html
that is displayed respectively before and after the (optional) result table. The
'testresults' field, if given, is a list of lists used to display some sort
of result table. The first row is the column-header row and all other rows
define the table body. Two special column header values exist: 'iscorrect'
and 'ishidden'. The \'iscorrect\' column(s) are used to display ticks or
crosses for 1 or 0 row values respectively. The 'ishidden' column isn't
actually displayed but 0 or 1 values in the column can be used to turn on and
off row visibility. Students do not see hidden rows but markers and other
staff do.

The 'showoutputonly' attribute, if set true, results in the prologuehtml and
epiloguehtml fields being displayed against a neutral background with the
usual outcome message (e.g. "Passed all tests") suppressed. The mode is intended
for use in pseudo-questions that can be used by students to experiment with a
given bit of code. If this attribute is true the 'fraction' attribute is not
required and is ignored if given. Since a mark is still required by the framework
when a question is checked, full marks are awarded regardless of the result of
the run but questions of this sort would normally not contribute marks towards
a student's grade.

The 'showdifferences' attribute can be added to the JSON outcome to render
the standard 'Show differences' button after the result table; it is displayed
only if there is actually a result table present and if full marks were not
awarded to the question.

Combinator-template grading gives the user complete control of the feedback to
the student as well as of the grading process. The ability to include HTML
in the feedback allows for complex output containing SVG or images.

The combinator-template grader has available to it the full list of all
test cases and their attributes (testcode, stdin, expected, mark, display etc)
for use in any way the question author sees fit. It is highly likely that
many of them will be disregarded or alternatively have some meaning completely
unlike their normal meaning in a programming environment. It is also
possible that a question using a combinator template grader will not
make use of test cases at all. For example it might test the students code with
thousands of random tests and display just a few of the failing cases using
the result table.

## Template grader examples
In this section we look at two uses of a per-test-case template grader,
both implemented in Python3. The first example shows how we can grade a
student submission that isn't actually code to be run but is some text to
be graded by a program. The second example, which is a bit more complicated,
shows how we can test student code in a more complex manner than simply running
tests and matching the output against the expected output.

### A simple grading-template example
A simple case in which one might use a template grader is where the
answer supplied by the student isn't actually code to be run, but is some
sort of raw text to be graded by computer. For example,
the student's answer might be the output of some simulation the student has
run. To simplify further, let's assume that the student's answer is
expected to be exactly 5 lines of text, which are to be compared with
the expected 5 lines, entered as the 'Expected' field of a single test case.
One mark is to be awarded for each correct line, and the displayed output
should show how each line has been marked (right or wrong).

A template grader for this situation might be the following

        import json

        got = """{{ STUDENT_ANSWER | e('py') }}"""
        expected = """{{ TEST.expected | e('py') }}"""
        got_lines = got.split('\n')
        expected_lines = expected.split('\n')
        mark = 0
        if len(got_lines) != 5:
            comment = "Expected 5 lines, got {}".format(len(got_lines))
        else:
            comment = ''
            for i in range(5):
                if got_lines[i] == expected_lines[i]:
                    mark += 1
                    comment += "Line {} right\n".format(i)
                else:
                    comment += "Line {} wrong\n".format(i)

        print(json.dumps({'got': got, 'comment': comment, 'fraction': mark / 5}))

Note that in the above program the Python *dictionary*

    {'got': got, 'comment': comment, 'fraction': mark / 5}

gets converted by the call to json.dumps to a JSON object string, which looks
syntactically similar but is in fact a different sort of entity altogether.
You should always use json.dumps, or its equivalent in other languages, to
generate a valid JSON string, handling details like escaping of embedded
newlines.

In order to display the *comment* in the output JSON, the
the 'Result columns' field of the question (in the 'customisation' part of
the question authoring form) should include that field and its column header, e.g.

        [["Expected", "expected"], ["Got", "got"], ["Comment", "comment"], ["Mark", "awarded"]]

The following two images show the student's result table after submitting
a fully correct answer and a partially correct answer, respectively.

### A more advanced grading-template example
A template-grader can also be used to grade programming questions when the
usual graders (e.g. exact or regular-expression matching of the program's
output) are inadequate.

As a simple example, suppose the student has to write their own Python square
root function (perhaps as an exercise in Newton-Raphson iteration?), such
that their answer, when squared, is within an absolute tolerance of 0.000001
of the correct answer. To prevent them from using the math module, any use
of an import statement would need to be disallowed but we'll ignore that aspect
in order to focus on the grading aspect.

The simplest way to deal with this issue is to write a series of testcases
of the form

        approx = student_sqrt(2)
        right_answer = math.sqrt(2)
        if math.abs(approx - right_answer) < 0.00001:
            print("OK")
        else:
            print("Fail (got {}, expected {})".format(approx, right_answer))

where the expected output is "OK". However, if one wishes to test the student's
code with a large number of values - say 100 or more - this approach becomes
impracticable. For that, we need to write our own tester, which we can do
using a template grade.

Template graders that run student-supplied code are somewhat tricky to write
correctly, as they need to output a valid JSON record under all situations,
handling problems like extraneous output from the student's code, runtime
errors or syntax error. The safest approach is usually to run the student's
code in a subprocess and then grade the output.

A per-test template grader for the student square root question, which tests
the student's *student_sqrt* function with 1000 random numbers in the range
0 to 1000, might be as follows:

        import subprocess, json, sys
        student_func = """{{ STUDENT_ANSWER | e('py') }}"""

        if 'import' in student_func:
            output = 'The word "import" was found in your code!'
            result = {'got': output, 'fraction': 0}
            print(json.dumps(result))
            sys.exit(0)

        test_program = """import math
        from random import uniform
        TOLERANCE = 0.000001
        NUM_TESTS = 1000
        {{ STUDENT_ANSWER | e('py') }}
        ok = True
        for i in range(NUM_TESTS):
            x = uniform(0, 1000)
            stud_answer = student_sqrt(n)
            right = math.sqrt(x)
            if abs(right - stud_answer) > TOLERANCE:
                print("Wrong sqrt for {}. Expected {}, got {}".format(x, right, stud_answer))
                ok = False
                break

        if ok:
            print("All good!")
        """
        try:
            with open('code.py', 'w') as fout:
                fout.write(test_program)
            output = subprocess.check_output(['python3', 'code.py'],
                stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, universal_newlines=True)
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
            output = e.output

        mark = 1 if output.strip() == 'All good!' else 0
        result = {'got': output, 'fraction': mark}
        print(json.dumps(result))

The following figures show this question in action.

Obviously, writing questions using template graders is much harder than
using the normal built-in equality based grader. It is usually possible to
ask the question in a different way that avoids the need for a custom grader.
In the above example, you would have to ask yourself if it mightn't have been
sufficient to test the function with 10 fixed numbers in the range 0 to 1000
using ten different test cases of the type suggested in the third
paragraph of this section.

## Customising the result table

The output from the standard graders is a list of so-called *TestResult* objects,
each with the following fields (which include the actual test case data):

    testcode      // The test that was run (trimmed, snipped)
    iscorrect     // True iff test passed fully (100%)
    expected      // Expected output (trimmed, snipped)
    mark          // The max mark awardable for this test
    awarded       // The mark actually awarded.
    got           // What the student's code gave (trimmed, snipped)
    stdin         // The standard input data (trimmed, snipped)
    extra         // Extra data for use by some templates


A field called *result_columns* in the question authoring form can be used
to control which of these fields are used, how the columns are headed and
how the data from the field is formatted into the result table.

By default the result table displays
the testcode, stdin, expected and got columns, provided the columns
are not empty. Empty columns are dropped from the table.
You can change the default, and/or the column headers
by entering a value for *result_columns* (leave blank for the default
behaviour). If supplied, the result_columns field must be a JSON-encoded
list of column specifiers.

The default value in English is

    [["Test", "testcode"], ["Input", "stdin"], ["Expected", "expected"], ["Got", "got"]]

The column headers are language dependent.

### Column specifiers

Each column specifier is itself a list,
typically with just two or three elements. The first element is the
column header, the second element is usually the field from the TestResult
object being displayed in the column (one of those values listed above) and the optional third
element is an `sprintf` format string used to display the field.
Per-test template graders can add their
own fields, which can also be selected for display. It is also possible
to combine multiple fields into a column by adding extra fields to the
specifier: these must precede the `sprintf` format specifier, which then
becomes mandatory. For example, to display a `Mark Fraction` column in the
form `0.74 out of 1.00`, a column format specifier of `["Mark Fraction", "awarded",
"mark", "%.2f out of %.2f"]` could be used.

### HTML formatted columns

As a special case, a format
of `%h` means that the test result field should be taken as ready-to-output
HTML and should not be subject to further processing; this can be useful
with custom-grader templates that generate HTML output, such as
SVG graphics, and we have also used it in questions where the output from
the student's program was HTML.

NOTE: `%h` format requires PHP >= 5.4.0 and Libxml >= 2.7.8 in order to
parse and clean the HTML output.

### Extended column specifier syntax (*obsolescent*)

It was stated above that the values to be formatted by the format string (if
given) were fields from the TestResult object. This is a slight simplification.
The syntax actually allows for expressions of the form:

        filter(testResultField [,testResultField]... )

where `filter` is the name of a built-in filter function that filters the
given testResult field(s) in some way. Currently the only such built-in
filter function is `diff`. This is (or was) a function
taking two test result fields as parameters and
returning an HTML string that representing the first test field with embedded
HTML &lt;ins&gt; and &lt;del&gt; elements that show the insertions and deletions
necessary
to convert the first field into the second. This was used to provide support
for the Show Differences button, which the user could click in order to
highlight differences between the *Expected* and *Got* fields. However that
functionality is now provided by JavaScript; the Show Differences button is
automatically displayed if an answer is being marked wrong and if an
exact-match grader is being used. Hence the *diff* filter function
is no longer functional but it remains supported syntactically to support
legacy questions that use it.

### Default result columns

The default value of *result_columns*  is:

`[["Test", "testcode"], ["Input", "stdin"], ["Expected", "expected"], ["Got", "got"]]`.

## User-interface selection

For normal programming questions, the Ace editor is used both for
author editing of the templates and for the student answer. Ace provides
syntax colouring, bracket matching, auto indent and many other programmer-oriented
capabilities to make editing of the underlying pure text more user-friendly.

Sometimes question authors ask questions in which the answer is not in fact
program code. For example, it might be a textual representation of an FSM
(finite state machine). In such questions the Ace editor is often not
appropriate. Prior to version 3.3, authors could turn off the Ace editor by
unchecking a *Use Ace* checkbox, but this disabled it both for student answers
and for the author's template.

Since version 3.3.0, CodeRunner now supports pluggable user interfaces,
although an administrator has to install the plugin. The two user interfaces
currently built in to CodeRunner are Ace and Graph. The question author selects the required
user interface via a dropdown menu in the customisation section of the question
author form. The selection controls editing of the sample answer and answer
preload fields of the authoring form and the student's answer in the live
quiz. The Ace editor is always used for editing the template itself, unless
turned off with the *Template uses ace* checkbox in the authoring
form.

### The Graph UI

The Graph UI plugin
provides simple graph-drawing capabilities to support
questions where the student is asked to draw or edit a graph. By default the
Graph UI, which was developed for Finite State Machines, draws directed graphs,
allows nodes to be marked as *Accept* states and allows incoming start edges.
For example:

<img src="http://coderunner.org.nz/pluginfile.php/56/mod_page/content/30/Selection_309.png" />

Clicking the Help button on the graph canvas displays information on how to
draw graphs.

Some limited control of the Graph UI is available to the question author
via template parameters as follows:

  1. isdirected - defaults to true. Set it to false for a non-directed graph.

  1. isfsm - defaults to false. Set it to true to allow edges to enter the
graph from space, i.e., without a start node. It also allows nodes to be marked
as accept states by double clicking.

  1. noderadius - defaults to 26. The radius of nodes, in pixels.

  1. fontsize - defaults to 20. The size of the Arial font, in px.

  1. textoffset. An offset in pixels used when positioning link label text.
      Default 4.

  1. locknodes. True to prevent the user from moving nodes. Useful when the
answer box is preloaded with a graph that the student has to annotate by
changing node or edge labels or by adding/removing edges. Note, though that
nodes can still be added and deleted.

  1. lockedges. True to prevent the user from dragging edges to change
their curvature. Possibly useful if the
answer box is preloaded with a graph that the student has to annotate by
changing node or edge labels or by adding/removing edges. Also ensures that
edges added by a student are straight, e.g. to draw a polygon on a set of
given points. Note, though that edges can still be added and deleted.

  1. helpmenutext - text to replace the default help menu text. Must be a
     single JSON string written on line using "\n" to separate lines in the menu.
     For example:

        {"helpmenutext": "Line1\nLine2\nLine3"}

    The default value, written here in multiple lines for readability, is:

        - Double click at a blank space to create a new node/state.
        - Double click an existing node to "mark" it e.g. as an accept state for Finite State Machines
          (FSMs). Double click again to unmark it.
        - Click and drag to move a node.
        - Alt click (or Ctrl alt click) and drag on a node to move a (sub)graph.
        - Shift click inside one node and drag to another to create a link.
        - Shift click on a blank space, drag to a node to create a start link (FSMs only).
        - Click and drag a link to alter its curve.
        - Click on a link/node to edit its text.
        - Typing _ followed by a digit makes that digit a subscript.
        - Typing \\epsilon creates an epsilon character (and similarly for \\alpha, \\beta etc).
        - Click on a link/node then press the Delete key to remove it (or function-delete on a Mac).

For example, for a non-directed non-fsm graph set the template parameters field to

        {"isdirected": false, "isfsm": false}

or merge those values into any other template parameters required by the
question.

Other template parameters may be added as required by specific questions.

Many thanks to Emily Price for the original implementation of the Graph UI.

All active CodeRunner user interface plugins in both the question authoring
form and the student's quiz page can be toggled off and on with a
CTRL-ALT-M keypress, alternately exposing and hiding the underlying textarea element.

### The Table UI

The table UI plug-in replaces the usual textarea answer element with an HTML table,
into which the student must enter text data. All cells in the table are
HTML *textarea* elements. The question author can enable *Add row* and
*Delete row* buttons that allow the student to add or delete rows. The configuration
of the table is set by the following template parameters, where the first two
are required and the rest are optional.

 o `table_num_rows` (required): sets the (initial) number of table rows, excluding the header.
 o `table_num_columns` (required): sets the number of table columns.
 o `table_column_headers` (optional): a list of strings used for column headers. By default
   no column headers are used.
 o `table_row_labels` (optional): a list of strings used for row labels. By
   default no row labels are used.
 o `table_column_width_percents` (optional): a list of numeric percentage widths of the different
   columns. For example, if there are two columns, and the first one is to
   occupy one-quarter of the available width, the list should be \[25, 75\].
   By default all columns have the same width.
 o `table_dynamic_rows` (optional): set `true` to enable the addition of *Add row*
   and *Delete row* buttons through which the student can alter the number of
   rows. The number of rows can never be less than the initial `table_num_rows` value.
 o `table_locked_cells` (optional): an array of 2-element [row, column] cell specifiers.
   The specified cells are rendered to HTML with the *disabled* attribute, so
   cannot be changed by the user. For example

        "table_locked_cells": [[0, 0], [1, 0]]

   to lock the leftmost column of rows 0 and 1.
   This is primarily for use in conjunction with
   an answer preload in which some cells are defined by the question author.
   The preload answer must be defined before the table_locked_cells template
   parameter is defined, or the question author will not be able to define
   the required values in the first place.

For example, the `python3\_program\_testing` question type uses the following
template parameter setting:

    {
        "table_num_rows": 3,
        "table_num_columns": 2,
        "table_column_headers": ["Test", "Result"],
        "table_dynamic_rows": true
    }

 The table serialisation is simply a JSON array of arrays containing all the
table cells excluding the header row.

As a special case of the serialisation, if all values in the serialisation
are empty strings, the serialisation is
itself the empty string.

An example of the use of this UI type can be seen in the
*python3_program_testing* prototype in the *samples* folder.

### The Gap Filler UI

This plugin replaces the usual textarea answer box with a div
consisting of pre-formatted text supplied by the question author in either the
"globalextra" field or the testcode field of the first test case, according
to the template parameter gapfiller_ui_source (default: globalextra).  HTML
entry or textarea elements are then inserted at
specified points. It is intended primarily for use with coding questions
where the answerbox presents the students with code that has smallish bits
missing, but it can also be used in non-coding questions.

The locations within the globalextra text at which the input elements are
to be inserted are denoted by "tags" of the form

    {[ size ]}

for an HTML input element

or

    {[ rows, columns ]}

for a textarea element

where size, rows and column are integer literals. These respectively
inject an HTML input element or a textarea element of the
specified size.

The serialisation of the answer box contents, i.e. the text that is
copied back into the textarea for submission
as the answer, is simply a list of all the field values (strings), in order.

As a special case of the serialisation, if the value list is empty, the
serialisation itself is the empty string.

The delimiters for the input element insertion tags are by default '{[' and
']}', but can be changed by an optional template parameter gap_filler_delimiters,
which must be a 2-element array of strings. For example:

    {"gap_filler_delimiters": ["{{", "}}"]}

Note that the double-brace delimiters in that example are the same as those
used by Twig, so using them instead of the default would prevent you from
ever adding Twig expansion (e.g. for randomisation) to the question. This is
not recommended.


### The Html UI

The HTML UI plug-in replaces the answer box with custom HTML provided by the
question author. The HTML will usually include data entry fields such as
html input and text area elements and it is the values that the user enters
into these fields that constitutes the student answer. The HTML can
also include JavaScript in `<script>` elements. Although
very powerful, the mechanism is complex and there are several pitfalls. Caveat
emptor!

When the answer is submitted by the student, the UI extracts the values of all
UI elements within the HTML that have the class 'coderunner-ui-element'.
Each such element
is expected to have a 'name' attribute as well and (name, value) pairs of all
such elements are used to construct a single JSON object which is copied into
the underlying textarea answerbox and returned as the answer. Since multiple
UI elements can have the same name, the values in the JSON represention of
the answer are always lists.  Each list contains all the values, in
document order, of the results of calling the jquery val() method in turn
on each of the UI elements with that name.
This means that at least input, select and textarea
elements are supported. Twig macros
are provided to simplify entry of those elements; see [this section](#twig-macros).

The author is responsible for checking the
compatibility of any other elements entered using raw HTML with jquery's val() method.

The HTML to use in the answer area must be provided as the contents of
the `globalextra` field in the question authoring form.

Care must be taken when using the HTML UI to avoid using field names that conflict
with any other named HTML elements in the page. It is recommended that a prefix
of some sort, such as `crui_`, be used with all names.

When authoring a question that uses the html UI, the answer and answer preload
fields are *not* controlled by the UI, but are displayed as raw text.
sections of the authoring form. If data is to be entered into these fields,
it must be of the form

    {"<fieldName>": "<fieldValueList>",...}

where fieldValueList is a list of all the values to be assigned to the fields
with the given name, in document order. For complex UIs it is easiest to turn
off validate on save, save the question, preview it, enter the right answers into
all fields, type CTRL-ALT-M to switch off the UI and expose the serialisation,
then copy that serialisation back into the author form.

It is possible that the question author might want a dynamic answer box in
which the student can add extra fields. A simple example of this is the Table UI,
which is a special case of the Html UI. The Table UI provides
an optional *Add rows* button, plus associated JavaScript, which allows
students to add rows to the table. The serialisation then contains more
data than can be accommodated in the fields of the original HTML. In the case of
the Table UI, where the same name is used for all cells in a table column,
the list of values for each name in the serialisation is longer than the number of
rows. In other dynamic HTML contexts, new elements with entirely new names may
have been added.

When the serialisation is reloaded back into the HTML all such leftover values
from the serialisation are assigned to the `data['leftovers']`
attribute of the outer html div, as a sub-object of the original object.
This outer div can be located as the 'closest' (in a jQuery sense)
`div.qtype-coderunner-html-outer-div`. The author-supplied HTML must include
JavaScript to make use of the 'leftovers'.

As a special case of the serialisation, if all values in the serialisation
are either empty strings or a list of empty strings, the serialisation is
itself the empty string.

### Other UI plugins

Question authors who have admin access to the Moodle server can write their
own user-interface plugins; a JavaScript
file with a name of the form `ui_something.js` in the
folder

        <moodlehome>/question/type/coderunner/amd/src

is assumed to be a user interface plugin and is automatically added to
the drop-down menu of available plugins. Such plugin files must be AMD modules
and must implement the interface defined in the file

        <moodlehome>/question/type/coderunner/amd/src/userinterfacewrapper.js

Writing UI plugins is, however, not a job for the faint hearted.

## User-defined question types

NOTE: User-defined question types are very powerful but are not for the faint
of heart. There are some known pitfalls, so please read the following very
carefully. You may also wish to watch the short [video introducing user-defined
question types](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-En_LN6qh4).

As explained earlier, each question type is defined by a prototype question,
which is just
another question in the database from which new questions can inherit. When
customising a question, if you open the *Advanced customisation* panel you'll
find the option to save your current question as a prototype. You will have
to enter a name for the new question type you're creating. It is strongly
recommended that you also change the name of your question to reflect the
fact that it's a prototype, in order to make it easier to find. The convention
is to start the question name with
the string PROTOTYPE\_, followed by the type name. For example,
PROTOTYPE\_python3\_OOP. Having a
separate PROTOTYPES category for prototype questions is also strongly recommended.
Obviously the
question type name you use should be unique, at least within the context of the course
in which the prototype question is being used.

The question text of a prototype question is displayed in the 'Question type
details' panel in the question authoring form.

CodeRunner searches for prototype questions
just in the current course context. The search includes parent
contexts, typically visible only to an administrator, such as the system
context; the built-in prototypes all reside in that system context. Thus if
a teacher in one course creates a new question type, it will immediately
appear in the question type list for all authors editing questions within
that course but it will not be visible to authors in other courses. If you wish
to make a new question type available globally you should ask a
Moodle administrator
to move the question to the system context, such as a LOCAL\_PROTOTYPES
category.

When you create a question of a particular type, including user-defined
types, all the so-called "customisable" fields are inherited from the
prototype. This means changes to the prototype will affect all the "children"
questions. **However, as soon as you customise a child question you copy all the
prototype fields and lose that inheritance.**

To reduce the UI confusion, customisable fields are subdivided into the
basic ones (per-test-template, grader, result-table column selectors etc) and
"advanced"
ones. The latter include the language, sandbox, timeout, memory limit and
the "make this question a prototype" feature.

The following section on supporting or implementing new languages shows in
detail the process for creating a new question type.

**WARNING #1:** if you define your own question type you'd better make sure
when you export your question bank
that you include the prototype, or all of its children will die on being imported
anywhere else!
Similarly, if you delete a prototype question that's actually
in use, all the children will break, giving "missing prototype" errors. To recover
from such screw ups you will need to create a new prototype
of the right name (preferably by importing the original correct prototype).
To repeat:
user-defined question types are not for the faint of heart. Caveat emptor.

**WARNING #2:** although you can define test cases in a question prototype,
e.g. for validation purposes, they are not inherited by the "children" of
the prototype.

## Supporting or implementing new languages

Most authors seem to assume that if they wish to write CodeRunner questions
that use a language not directly supported by the Jobe sandbox, they must
first modify the Jobe code to support the new language. That is not the case, although
the required language does of course need to be installed on the Jobe server. A much
easier, more convenient and more maintainable approach is to use a Python
question type that compiles (if necessary) and runs the student code in
a Python subprocess. Indeed, in recent years at the University of Canterbury
nearly all new question types have been scripted in Python, even those using
languages built into Jobe. For
example, the question type we now use for all question in the C programming
course is a Python3 question type parses the student's C program and performs
lots of checks on things like function length and use of various C constructs
before compiling and running the submitted code.

The template code below shows a simple example in which a Python question
prototype is used to define a new question type *c\_via\_python* that mimics
the built-in *c\_program* question type but provides more flexibility. To create
the new question type using this template:

 1. Create a new CodeRunner question.
 1. Choose the question type *python3*
 1. Click *Customise*
 1. Replace the contents of the *Template* text area with the template code below.
 1. Uncheck the *Is combinator* checkbox
 1. Enter DEMO\_PROTOTYPE\_C\_using\_python as the question name
 1. Enter whatever text you wish to use to describe the question type in the
    Question text area. This text will be displayed to any authors using this
    new question type if they open the *Question type details* section of the
    question authoring form.
 1. Open Advanced Customisation
 1. Set *Is prototype?* to *Yes (user defined)*
 1. Set *Question type* to *c\_via\_python*.
 1. Set *Ace language* to *c*, so that the students' code will be edited as C
    even though the prototype is in Python.
 1. Save the question.

You should now find the new question type *c\_via\_python* appearing in the
*Question type* dropdown of the author edit form for a new CodeRunner
question. This new question type should behave like the built-in c\_program
question type but is more flexible; for example, it can easily be extended to perform
checks on the submitted C code prior to compilation.

The full
question prototype for the *c\_via\_python* question type
is included in the *samples* folder of the CodeRunner
distribution.

    """ The template for a question type that compiles and runs a student-submitted
        C program.
    """

    import subprocess, sys

    # Write the student code to a file prog.c
    student_answer = """{{ STUDENT_ANSWER | e('py') }}"""
    with open("prog.c", "w") as src:
        print(student_answer, file=src)

    # Compile
    {% if QUESTION.parameters.cflags is defined %}
    cflags = """{{ QUESTION.parameters.cflags | e('py') }}"""
    {% else %}
    cflags = "-std=c99 -Wall -Werror"
    {% endif %}
    return_code = subprocess.call("gcc {0} -o prog prog.c".format(cflags).split())
    if return_code != 0:
        print("** Compilation failed. Testing aborted **", file=sys.stderr)

    # If compile succeeded, run the code. Since this is a per-test template,
    # stdin is already set up for the stdin text specified in the test case,
    # so we can run the compiled program directly.
    if return_code == 0:
        try:
            output = subprocess.check_output(["./prog"], universal_newlines=True)
            print(output)
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
            if e.returncode > 0:
                # Ignore non-zero positive return codes
                if e.output:
                    print(e.output)
            else:
                # But negative return codes are signals - abort
                if e.output:
                    print(e.output, file=sys.stderr)
                if e.returncode < 0:
                    print("Task failed with signal", -e.returncode, file=sys.stderr)
                print("** Further testing aborted **", file=sys.stderr)


## Multilanguage questions

By extending the above approach it is possible to write questions that can be
answered in multiple languages. Multi-language questions are enabled by setting
the Ace-language field within the Advanced Customisation section of a
question to a comma-separated
list of languages. Students are then presented with a drop-down menu which they
use to select
the language in which their answer is written. If exactly one of the languages
has an asterisk (\'\*\') appended, that language is chosen as the default language,
selected as the initial state of the drop-down menu. For example,
an Ace-language value of "C,C++,Java\*,Python3" would allow student to submit in
C, C++, Java or Python3 but the drop-down menu would initially show Java which
would be the default. If no default is specified the
initial state of the drop-down is empty and the student must choose a language.
Multilanguage questions require a special template that uses the {{ANSWER\_LANGUAGE}}
template variable to control how to execute the student code.
The {{ANSWER\_LANGUAGE}} variable is meaningfully defined only for multilanguage questions;
it is the empty string, otherwise.

The template for a multilanguage question is a generalisation of the template
shown in the previous section. It is essentially a single large case statement
of the following form (assuming the sandbox language is Python3):

    import subprocess
    import re
    student_answer = """{{ STUDENT_ANSWER | e('py') }}"""
    language = """{{ ANSWER_LANGUAGE | e('py') }}""".lower()
    if language == 'c':
        # Code to run a C program, as in the previous section
    elif language == 'python3':
        # Code to execute student_answer in Python3 directly
    elif language == 'java':
        # Code to run a Java program, modified from that in the previous section

    ... etc


For a fully working version of such a question type, see the implementation
of the built-in multilanguage question type, `BUILT_IN_PROTOTYPE_multilanguage`.
If you're a system administrator, you'll find the question prototype in the
System/CR_PROTOTYPES category. If not, create a new question of
type *multilanguage*, customise it, and examine its template. You can also
inspect the entire question prototype in XML form within the repository
file `db/builtin_PROTOTYPES.xml`. Note that the prototype is
a non-combinator question, i.e. it does a separate run for each test case, which
isn't efficient for sluggish languages like Java.

If the author wishes to supply a sample answer to a multilanguage question,
they must write it in the default language, if specified, or the
first of the allowed languages otherwise.

## Administrator scripts

There are currently three CodeRunner-related utility scripts available.
While initially intended only for administrator use, they
are proving useful to teachers as well, particularly the third one.
Teachers are able to run the scripts
only within courses they can normally access; they must be logged into such
a course before attempting to run the scripts.

The three scripts are:

 1. &lt;moodle_home&gt;/question/type/coderunner/bulktestindex.php
    This script displays a list of all question categories accessible to the
    user who is currently logged into Moodle on the machine running the script.
    Each category is displayed as a clickable link that then runs a script that
    tests the sample answers on all questions in that category, reporting
    all successes and failures.

 1. &lt;moodle_home&gt;/question/type/coderunner/prototypeusageindex.php
    This scripts displays an index like the one above except that the
    clickable links now run a script that reports on the question prototype
    usage within that category.

 1. &lt;moodle_home&gt;/question/type/coderunner/downloadquizattempts.php
    This script, which is still experimental,
    displays a list of all quizzes available to the logged in user,
    allowing them to download a spreadsheet of all submissions to a selected quiz
    by all students. The downloaded spreadsheet is suitable for off-line analysis,
    and includes information not available in the exported Moodle responses
    file, such as all intermediate submisssions and prechecks and the time of
    each such action.

    The download can be in either csv or excel format; the
    latter is recommended for most cases because a long-standing bug in PHP's
    `fputcsv` function can cause corrupted csv output files. The exported
    Excel spreadsheet can then be opened in Excel or Open Office and saved as
    csv.

    The download format is complicated and requires a good understanding of
    Moodle's database scheme. The following query is used, with each row of the
    result being output as a single spreadsheet row.

        SELECT
            concat(quiza.uniqueid, qasd.attemptstepid, qasd.id) as uniquekey,
            quiza.uniqueid as quizattemptid,
            timestart,
            timefinish,
            u.firstname,
            u.lastname,
            u.email,
            qatt.slot,
            qatt.questionid,
            quest.name as qname,
            slot.maxmark as mark,
            qattsteps.timecreated as timestamp,
            FROM_UNIXTIME(qattsteps.timecreated,'%Y/%m/%d %H:%i:%s') as datetime,
            qattsteps.fraction,
            qattsteps.state,
            qasd.attemptstepid,
            qasd.name as qasdname,
            qasd.value as value

        FROM {user} u
        JOIN {quiz_attempts} quiza ON quiza.userid = u.id AND quiza.quiz = :quizid
        JOIN {question_attempts} qatt ON qatt.questionusageid = quiza.uniqueid
        JOIN {question_attempt_steps} qattsteps ON qattsteps.questionattemptid = qatt.id
        JOIN {question_attempt_step_data} qasd on qasd.attemptstepid = qattsteps.id
        JOIN {question} quest ON quest.id = qatt.questionid
        JOIN {quiz_slots} slot ON qatt.slot = slot.slot AND slot.quizid = quiza.quiz

        WHERE quiza.preview = 0
        AND (qasd.name NOT RLIKE '^-_' OR qasd.name = '-_rawfraction')
        AND (qasd.name NOT RLIKE '^_' OR qasd.name = '_testoutcome')
        AND quest.length > 0
        ORDER BY quiza.uniqueid, timestamp;

    This query gives rise to multiple near-identical rows for a single student
    action (e.g. answer submission), with different (qasdname, value) pairs.
    ['qasdname' is
    the `name` column of the question-attempt-step-data table and `value` is
    the value associated with that name. The set of such (key, value) pairs
    depends on the question type and the particular user action being recorded.]
    Currently, so-called "behaviour variables" - those containing an underscore - are
    not included in the export, except for the '-_rawfraction' variable. This
    is to restrict the volume of data, but the decision may change in the future.

    Processing of the raw spreadsheet is somewhat complicated. The file
    `quizsubmissions.py` included in the git repository defines Python classes to
    simplify the process. The statements

        from quizsubmissions import QuizSubmissions
        submission_data = QuizSubmissions(csvfilename)

    import the exported spreadsheet and gives easy access to data about any
    particular student and their activities in the quiz.

    For example

        submission-data['rjl83'].submissions[2].get_answer()

    returns the final answer submitted by student `rjl83` to question 2.

    Lots of other information, such as the student's name, all intermediate
    submissions and prechecks and their times etc is available.
    See `quizsubmissions.py` for  more information.


## A note on accessibility

To assist the use of screen readers for visually impaired students,
text area inputs now have two modes:

* When keyboard focus first enters them via Tab or Shift+TAb, they are
  in 'non-capturing' mode, and pressing TAB or Shift+TAB moves to the
  next or previous form control.

* After you start typing, or if focus enters by way of a click, they go
  into Tab-capturing mode, and then pressing Tab indents.

* CTRL+M switches modes (as recommended by
  https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#richtext).

* Esc always switches to non-capturing mode.


## APPENDIX 1: How questions get marked

CodeRunner is a rather complex system and, being web based, is driven by
user-events. In this Appendix we attempt to describe the effective
behaviour using pseudocode algorithms.

An understanding of the Twig template engine is assumed in what follows.
See [the Twig documentation](https://twig.symfony.com/) if you are not
familiar with Twig. CodeRunner uses standard Twig, except for the addition
of a [set_random_seed](https://github.com/trampgeek/moodle-qtype_coderunner#randomising-per-student-rather-than-per-question-attempt]
function and some [extra escapers](https://github.com/trampgeek/moodle-qtype_coderunner#twig-escapers).

### When a question is first instantiated.

When a student starts a quiz, an instance of each question in the quiz has
be be created. It's at the point that any environmental context, such as
the student's name, plus any randomisation, gets established. To ensure that
any randomisation done by the template remains locked in to all subsequent
views and attempts of the question within this quiz by the current student, a
new random number seed is generated and stored in the question at this stage.
That seed
is used for all subsequent randomisation except that the question
author can explicitly call the *set_random_seed* function to use a different
seed, such as the student's ID number.

That initialisation process can be described as follows:
<pre>
    <b>procedure</b> create_question_instance(question):
        question.student = get_current_moodle_user_info()
        question.prototype = locate_prototype_question(question.prototype_name)
        question.random_seed = make_new_random_seed()
        set_twig_environment(question.random_seed, question.student)
        question.template_params = twig_expand(question.template_params)
        <b>if</b> question.prototype has template parameters:
            prototype_params = twig_expand(question.prototype.template_params)
            question.template_params = merge_json(prototype_params, question.template_params)
        <b>if</b> question.twigall:
            # Twig expand question text, sample answer, answer preload,
            # all test case fields and global extra. The just-computed
            # template parameters provide (most of) the twig environment.
            set_twig_environment(question.random_seed,
                question.student, question.template_params)
            <b>for each</b> twiggable attribute of question:
                question.attribute = twig_expand(question.attribute)
        save question instance
</pre>

### Grading a submission

When the user clicks the *Check* button (or *Precheck* if turned on), the
current answer is graded. The "current answer" comprises:

1. The code in the answer box or, more generally, the serialised text returned
   by the selected UI (user interface) plug-in. For coding questions, the
   UI is usually the Ace code-editor so the serialised text is just the raw
   code without syntax colouring. Other UIs (e.g. GraphUI, TableUI, GapFillerUI)
   have their own unique serialisations; see the UI plug-in documentation for
   details.

1. The set of student-supplied attached files, if attachments are enabled.

The grading process involves expanding the question template, executing the
code and grading the result. However, the process is complicated by the
choice of sandbox, whether the question uses a so-called "combinator" or not (i.e.
whether it attempts to combine all test-cases into a single run), whether the
question requires that different standard input be set for each test case,
whether it's a precheck or a full check and
what grading method has been selected (Exact Match, Near Exact Match,
Regular Expression, or Template Grader).

Another complication relates to the environment in which the question's template
gets expanded by Twig, i.e. the set of "template parameters". In legacy code
the template refers to the question's template parameters using a notation like

    {{ QUESTION.parameters.sometemplateparam }}

but there is now a checkbox called 'Hoist template parameters', defaulting to true,
which adds the template parameters directly to the Twig environment, allowing
the question author to refer directly to

    {{ sometemplateparam }}

In the following pseudocode, we assume Hoist template parameters is true.

Although CodeRunner is set up to use a variety of different sandboxes, in
recent years only the Jobe sandbox has been supported, so we will generally disregard
all other sandboxes. However, it sometimes helps to remember that CodeRunner
could in principle use different sandboxes, and that not all sandboxes might
provide the same functionality as Jobe e.g., setting of maximum
memory or maximum runtime.

<pre>
    <b>function</b> grade_response(question, attachments, is_precheck):
        # Grade the current submission and return a table of test results
        if question.answer plus current set of attachments has already been graded:
            return cached results
        test_cases = select_subset_of_tests(question.testcases, is_precheck)
        run_results = None
        <b>if</b> question.is_combinator and (template grader is being used or
            question.allow_multiple_stdins or all stdins are empty strings):
            # Try running the combinator. If something breaks, e.g. a
            # testcase times out, the result will be None.
            Set up the Twig environment (templateParams) to consist of all
                the variables in question.templateParams plus STUDENT_ANSWER,
                IS_PRECHECK, ANSWER_LANGUAGE, and ATTACHMENTS. Additionally
                the entire question is made available as the parameter QUESTION.
            run_results = run_combinator(question, testcases, templateParams)
        <b>if</b> run_result is not None:
            run_results = []
            <b>for</b> each test in test_cases:
                run_results.append(run_single_testcase(question, test, templateParams)
        <b>return</b> run_results
</pre>

<p>The algorithms used in `run_combinator` and `run_single_testcase` are

<pre>
    <b>function</b> run_combinator(question, testcases, templateParams)

    *** TBS ***
</pre>

## APPENDIX 2: How programming quizzes should work

Historical notes and a diatribe on the use of Adaptive Mode questions ...

The original pycode was inspired by [CodingBat](http://codingbat.com), a site where
students submit Python or Java code that implements a simple function or
method, e.g. a function that returns twice the square of its parameter plus 1.
The student code is executed with a series of tests cases and results are
displayed immediately after submission in a simple tabular form showing each
test case, expected answer
and actual answer. Rows where the answer computed by the student's code
is correct receive a large green tick; incorrect rows
receive a large red cross. The code is deemed correct only if all tests
are ticked. If code is incorrect, students can simply correct it and resubmit.

*CodingBat* proves extraordinarily effective as a student training site. Even
experienced programmers receive pleasure from the column of green ticks and
all students are highly motivated to fix their code and retry if it fails one or more
tests. Some key attributes of this success, to be incorporated into *pycode*,
were:

1. Instant feedback. The student pastes their code into the site, clicks
*submit*, and almost immediately receives back their results.

1. All-or-nothing correctness. If the student's code fails any test, it is
wrong. Essentially (thinking in a quiz context) it earns zero marks. Code
has to pass *all* tests to be deemed mark-worthy.

1. Simplicity. The question statement should be simple. The solution should
also be reasonably simple. The display of results is simple and the student
knows immediately what test cases failed. There are no complex regular-expression
failures for the students to puzzle over nor uncertainties over what the
test data was.

1. Rewarding green ticks. As noted above, the colour and display of a correct
results table is highly satisfying and a strong motivation to succeed.

The first two of these requirements are particularly critical. While they can
be accommodated within Moodle by using an *adaptive* quiz behaviour
in conjunction with an all-or-nothing marking scheme, they are not
how many people view a Moodle quiz. Quizzes are
commonly marked only after submission of all questions, and there is usually
a perception that part marks will be awarded for "partially correct" answers.
However, awarding marks to a piece of code according to how many test cases
it passes can give almost meaningless results. For example, a function that
always just returns 0, or the empty list or equivalent, will usually pass several
of the tests, but surely it shouldn't be given *any* marks? Seriously flawed
code, for example a string tokenizing function that works only with alphabetic
data, may get well over half marks if the question-setter was not expecting
such flaws.

Accordingly, CodeRunner questions always use Moodle's adaptive behaviour,
regardless of the behaviour set for the quiz in which the questions are being
run. Students can check their code for correctness as soon as it has been
entered and, if their answer is wrong, can resubmit, usually for a
small penalty. The mark obtained in a
programming-style quiz is thus determined primarily by how many of the problems the
student can solve in the given time, and secondarily by how many submissions the student
needs to make on each question.

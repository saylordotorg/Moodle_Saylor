# Releasing new ILIAS version

This page records the steps needed to take `qtype_stack` (originally designed for Moodle) and create an updated working ILIAS plugin.

1. All code needed for the ILIAS plugin should be available in the `stack` directory (from the top level).
2. TODO: how to get updated language packs?
3. TOTO: How to map Moodle specific functions (e.g. `stack_string`) to the ILIAS version?

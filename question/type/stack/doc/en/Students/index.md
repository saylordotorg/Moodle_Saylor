# Information for students

STACK is software for setting and automatically marking mathematical questions as part of a Moodle quiz.

You are normally expected to type in your answer using a simple linear syntax, details of which are given on the [Answer input](Answer_input.md) page.
Then you _submit_ your answer and it is [assessed](Answer_assessment.md).

* STACK establishes that your answer is _valid_.
* Next it decides if you are _correct_, and assigns _feedback_.
* Multiple attempts at a question are usually encouraged.
* You will often be given randomly generated questions, so you may be able to practice similar questions.

You can also read about [accessibility features](Accessibility.md) and how to use the [equivalence reasoning](Equivalence_reasoning.md) input.

There is also page for frequently asked questions, [FAQ](FAQ.md).

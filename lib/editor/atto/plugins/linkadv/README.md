# moodle-atto_linkadv

This is an atto plugin for Moodle which is a drop-in replacement for the default atto_link plugin.

It adds an extra couple of fields to the link dialog: id and class. These allow the user to create bookmarks or add styles to their links (e.g. btn btn-primary for Bootstrap-based themes).

## Installation
1.  Drop code into /lib/editor/atto/plugins
2.  Go to Site administration -> Notifications to install

## Credits

Extended atto_links, and borrowed a little from atto_media for the tabs.

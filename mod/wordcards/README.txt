Poodll Wordcards Module for Moodle
=============

This a word learning plugin for Moodle. Words or phrases to be learnt are introduced with each instance of the activity. Students learn and review words by completing listen-and-type, choose-the-answer, speechcards or type-the-words tasks.
Previously introduced words are shown for review in subsequent instances of the activity in the course. The review pool is maintained per learner and will show words the activity believes the learner needs to review.

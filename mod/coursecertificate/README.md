Course certificate
==================

Automatically issue digital certificates to course participants.

The course certificate module provides an opportunity for learners to celebrate achievements
by obtaining certificates.

It allows you to choose from different certificate templates which will automatically display
user data such as full name, course, etc.

Users will be able to download a PDF copy of the certificate themselves by accessing this activity,
and there are options to send a PDF copy to them by email automatically.

If the template used on this activity contains a QR code, users will be able to scan it to validate
their certificates.

The Course certificate plugin works together with the **Certificate manager plugin (tool_certificate)**.
The Certificate manager plugin has to be installed, it provides the API and UI for
designing the certificate templates on system and course category level.

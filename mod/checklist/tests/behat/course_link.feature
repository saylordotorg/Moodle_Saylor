    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I turn editing mode on
    And I add a "Checklist" to section "1" and I fill the form with:
      | Checklist                                  | Test checklist       |
      | Introduction                               | This is a checklist  |
      | Updates by                                 | Student only         |
      | Check-off when courses or modules complete | Yes, cannot override |

  @javascript
  Scenario: A teacher can link to a course or a URL, but not both
    Given I am on the "Test checklist" "checklist activity" page
    When I set the following fields to these values:
      | displaytext | Item with course link |
      | linkurl     | moodle.org            |
    And the "linkcourseid" "field" should be disabled
    And I press "Add"
    And I follow "Edit this item"
    Then the following fields match these values:
      | displaytext | Item with course link |
      | linkurl     | http://moodle.org     |

    When I set the following fields to these values:

      | linkcourseid | Course 2              |
    And I press "Update"
    And I follow "Preview"
    Then I should see "Item with course link"
    And I follow "Course associated with this item"
    And I should see "Course 2"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Students cannot check-off items linked to courses, when autocomplete (no override) is on

    And the field "Item with course link" matches value "0"
    And the field "Another item with course link" matches value "0"

    When I set the field "Another item with course link" to "1"
    And I wait "2" seconds

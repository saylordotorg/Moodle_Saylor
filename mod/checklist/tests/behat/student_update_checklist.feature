  Scenario: When a student ticks/unticks items on a checklist their progress is updated
    When I am on the "Test checklist" "checklist activity" page logged in as "student1"
    Then I should see "0%" in the "#checklistprogressrequired" "css_element"
    And I should see "0%" in the "#checklistprogressall" "css_element"
    # Tick item 2.
    When I click on "Checklist required item 2" "text"
    Then I should see "33%" in the "#checklistprogressrequired" "css_element"
    And I should see "20%" in the "#checklistprogressall" "css_element"
    # Tick item 3.
    When I click on "Checklist required item 3" "text"
    Then I should see "67%" in the "#checklistprogressrequired" "css_element"
    And I should see "40%" in the "#checklistprogressall" "css_element"
    # Untick item 2.
    When I click on "Checklist required item 2" "text"
    Then I should see "33%" in the "#checklistprogressrequired" "css_element"

    # Untick item 3.
    When I click on "Checklist required item 3" "text"

    # Delay to allow AJAX to clear before resetting DB (avoids test-failing popup).
    And I wait "2" seconds

  @javascript
  Scenario: When a student updates their progress and then returns to the page their progress is remembered
    Given I am on the "Test checklist" "checklist activity" page logged in as "student1"

    And I click on "Checklist required item 3" "text"

    # Note - the rounding here is inconsistent between JS & PHP, but I am cautious about fixing it.
    And I should see "66%" in the "#checklistprogressrequired" "css_element"
    And I should see "60%" in the "#checklistprogressall" "css_element"

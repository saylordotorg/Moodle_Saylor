  In order to trigger reengagements
  As a teacher
  I need to create a reengagement

  Scenario: Create Reengagment activity.
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | summary                             | category | timecreated   | timemodified  |
      | Course 1 | C1        | Prove the reengagement activity works | 0        | ##yesterday## | ##yesterday## |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email                |

    And I add a "Reengagement" to section "1" and I fill the form with:
      | Reengagement name        | Reengagement test       |
    Then I should see "Reengagement test"

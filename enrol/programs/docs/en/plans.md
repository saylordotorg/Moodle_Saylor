# Known problems and future plans

## Known problems

1. incomplete test coverage
2. program management can be delegated only at category level, this is the same problem as with cohort management - it would be beneficial to introduce a new general context level for system and course category level entities
3. privacy provider is not fully implemented
4. program groups are not protected, fix would require changes in core Moodle

## Planned features, improvements and ideas

1. navigation improvements
2. web services for program management
3. program and allocation snapshot reports
4. data export
5. program allocation import from uploaded file
6. program catalogue improvements
7. support for source classes defined in other plugins
8. documentation improvements
9. certifications based on programs

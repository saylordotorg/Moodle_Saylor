# AutoEnrol Enrolment Method

AutoEnrol adds functionality to automatically enrol users onto a course, either as they 
log in to your Moodle site or as they access a course. This plugin was at first intended 
for use on courses which you want all users to be able to access but can also be configured
for more advanced purposes as reserved access courses. Using the new user filtering you can
think at Autoenrol as a Swiss Army knife for Moodle enrolments.

When added to a course this enrolment plugin can enrol users onto a course automatically,
either as they log into your Moodle site or as they click on the course. It was originally
intended for use on site-wide courses such as "Moodle Help" or "Learner Voice". 

In addition the plugin has advanced functionality to support automatically grouping and
filtering users based upon their attributes. Depending on how your user accounts are set
up this may help you to give access to certain user groups.

Configuration of the plugin is managed by two capabilities which allow administrators to 
easily control who has access to the plugin.

The AutoEnrol filter use moodle standard availability interface so it adds great flexibility 
in user filtering.
The moodle profile availability core plugin unfortunately does not include language and 
authentication method.  If you need them, you can install additional availability plugins 
like [Restriction by language](https://moodle.org/plugins/availability_language) and 
[Restriction by authentication](https://github.com/bobopinna/moodle-availability_auth).

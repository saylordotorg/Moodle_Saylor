# Edit roles by capability tool [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/moodleou/moodle-block_workflow.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/moodleou/moodle-block_workflow)

Administrators can define workflows which can then be applied to Courses of activities.
A workflow is a sequence of steps. Each step has a role who is responsible
for doing it, some instructions, and possibly some tasks to tick off.
When one task is complete, the people responsible for the next task can be notified.
Also, when a step starts or becomes complete, various automated actions can be scripted to occur.

For more documentation, see https://docs.moodle.org/en/The_OU_workflow_system.

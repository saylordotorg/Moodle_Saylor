## Easily create, manage and display notifications/alerts to users

[![Functionality](docs/AdvNotifications.gif)](docs/AdvNotifications.gif)

#### Notification Anatomy

#### Installation Notice

All the plugin's settings are disabled by default. Enable it upon installation if you wish to start using it immediately or enable it later by navigating to Site Administration > Plugins > Blocks > Advanced Notifications. 


#### Backwards Compatibility/Progressive Enhancement

Although the plugin works and is usable without JavaScript, it is highly recommended to use the plugin with JavaScript enabled.
Using the plugin with JavaScript disabled does not allow for some features to be used to their full potential ranging from dismissing a notification to dynamically editing existing notifications and the live-preview feature - all of which relies on JavaScript in some form to make the user's experience more enjoyable.


#### Pull Requests

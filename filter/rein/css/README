Documentation for rein.js Filter CSS Directory
==============================================
This directory contains all CSS files loaded by the filter.  For compression, they are processed during development using SASS. 

To Install SASS
---------------
# Install Ruby.
# Run `gem install sass`.

To Compress
-----------
To compile the compressed styles.css file, run the following command from the `/css` directory:
    sass -t compressed styles.scss styles.css

If additional files are added, these files should have their extension changed to .scss.
styles.scss also needs to be edited to @import the new file.  Place the imports in the order
in which the files should be loaded (last file to load is listed as last import).

The sass command compresses all .scss files into a single file.  This file is then cached and served to the client by the filter.

Normally this compile step should be a part of the development process, run any time
that any of the .scss files is changed, and committed to the repo.  There may be times when
it is necessary to run sass during integration.  Possible scenarios are when two separate
work in progress branches modify .scss files.

During the compression process, SASS will create a .sass-cache subdirectory and write cached .scssc files there. The plugin's .gitignore is set to ignore this subdirectory.
